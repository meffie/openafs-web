Attendees:  Jeff Altman, Harald Barth, Derrick Brashear, Todd DeSantis, Jim
Rees, Jeff Schiller, Laura Stentz, Warren Yenson.

Summary:

*  Development Update - We have been working through a few issues on the
UNIX and Windows operating systems, but all are fixed (or have
workarounds).  1.5.2 is in progress.

*  Equipment Update - We have had to return our Apple equipment.  However,
Derrick/Sine Nomine have purchased equipment.  In addition, Morgan Stanley
is planning to donate an Opteron (x86_64) machine to OpenAFS via CMU.
Warren is working out the specifics with CMU.

*  Workshop Update/Attendance - Jeff Altman, Derrick Brashear, Todd
DeSantis (Tues-Friday AM), Jim Rees, Warren Yenson (Wednesday-Thursday) are
the Elders who will be attending the Workshop.  On Wednesday evening, there
is a  "Meet/Greet the Elders" event at dinner.    The Elders would also
like to have a  Wednesday lunch meeting (for Elders only).  Another social
event and opportunity to talk with OpenAFS users is Thursday evening drinks
and appetizers at a local brew pub.

*Elders - Change in Affiliation:  Warren Yenson is leaving Morgan Stanley
at the end of this week, and he is moving to Google's Application Support
and Systems Administration Group.  While Google does not use OpenAFS,
Warren would like to remain on the Council of Elders at this time.  He will
re-evaluate his position a few months into the job at Google.  If he is
still able to contribute to the Elders, he'd like to remain on the Council.

Next Meeting:

Tuesday, June 27  1:00-1:30 Eastern

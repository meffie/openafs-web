– November 2007</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>An Update to the OpenAFS 
Community compiled by the Advisory Council</i></font></p>
<h1><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Introduction</b></font></h1>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The OpenAFS Newsletter is intended 
to be a regular communiqué from the OpenAFS Elders to the community 
of OpenAFS administrators and end users.  In these newsletters 
the Elders will summarize the activities of the OpenAFS community, the 
progress that has been achieved in OpenAFS development, and outline 
the road map of future development that could be accomplished with the 
availability of sufficient resources. It is hoped that these newsletters 
will strengthen the community and foster additional dialogues and participation.</font></p>
<h1><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Council 
of Elders Monthly Meeting</b></font></h1>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The OpenAFS Advisory Council 
met on November 13.  The following topics were discussed in the 
meeting:  Development, AFS &amp; Kerberos Best Practices Workshop, 
Documentation, and OpenAFS communications.  Minutes of the meeting 
can be found at:  </font><a href="http://www.openafs.org/eldershttp://www.openafs.org/elders/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>http://www.openafs.org/eldersht<WBR>tp://www.openafs.org/elders/</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">JA</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Council of Elders - Member 
Resignation</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Warren Yenson has resigned 
from the OpenAFS Council of Elders because he is no longer actively 
involved in OpenAFS development or with OpenAFS customers.   
Warren had been closely involved with OpenAFS in his position at Morgan 
Stanley, but he has not been involved with AFS in his position at Google.  
The Council of Elders would like to thank Warren for his contributions 
to OpenAFS and wish him well in the future.</font></p>
<h1><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>OpenAFS Development Update</b></font></h1>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>UNIX/Linux Servers</u></font> <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">1.4.5 packages have 
  been uploaded to Debian.  </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 1.4 backport 
  of the Kerberos multiple-realm patch will be pulled into the Debian 
  packages so that it can be more broadly tested.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There will be additional 
  work to improve Documentation, including Russ committing pending contributions 
  from Jason Edgecomb.  </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Stanford and Sine 
  Nomine are persuing a file server problem that&#39;s causing periodic segfaults 
  due to an apparent free list corruption.  Once this bug is identified 
  and fixed, it should be included in a 1.4.6 release.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Russ is going to 
  try to get some resources at Stanford to start testing the demand-attach 
  fileserver.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>UNIX/Linux Clients</u></font> <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">OpenAFS 1.4.5 was 
  released and includes support for Leopard, Solaris 10-update 4, and 
  new Linux support.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Bug fixes proposed 
  for 1.4.6 include verifying viced-accurately-track-file<WBR>-callbacks-20071112 
  fixes the bug seen with CBFree/FEFree corruption, viced-missing-lock-20071109, 
  libafsrpc-makefile-fix-20071110 for RPMS, linux-nsec-timestamp-zero<WBR>-20071106,

  linux-afs-unlinked-file-dentry<WBR>-flagging-20071031, and various Mac and 
  RPM packaging files.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Pending work includes 
  module unload cleanup, afs_HashOutDCache panic, and an Rx error.  </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Longer term, there 
  is work planned to stabilize 1.5 so that we are able to put out 1.6 
  series releases.  There has also been discussion with the HePiX 
  communithy regarding a timeout issue which limits AFS throughput.  
  Derrick is working with Rainer Toebbicke regarding his Rx test tool 
  to resolve this matter.  He is also working with Hartmut Reuter 
  to integrate his AFS OSD code.  However, the timing of this work 
  depends on the availability of resources.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Windows Clients</u></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There have been three OpenAFS 
for Windows releases since the last Elders meeting:  OpenAFS 1.5.25 
(9/20/07), 1.5.26 (10/23/07), and 1.5.27 (11/7/07).  Details of 
these releases can be found at <a href="http://openafs.org" target="_blank">openafs.org</a>. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The following work is changes 
have been made post 1.5.27:</font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Optimization of 
  the performance of the Windows cache manager.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A new option which 
  permits .readonly callbacks to be automatically renewed prior to expiration.  
  This option can reduce load on .readonly volumes over long periods of 
  time. However, it is an optional feature since it will resulte in a 
  single FetchStgatus request being sent per .readonly volume whether 
  or not the client is actively using that volume.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Future work plans for OpenAFS 
Windows Development include:</font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">OpenAFS Redirector 
  work (in progress)</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">OpenAFS File System 
  Filter Driver that will permit \\AFS to be used without requiring the 
  presence of the Microsoft Loopback Adapter.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Implementation 
  of Extended Attributes by storing data in the Apple Double Files as 
  described in RFC 1740.</font></li>
</ul>
<h2><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>In-depth Focus on Ongoing 
Development:  Documentation</b></font></h2>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Work is slowly proceeding on 
improving the OpenAFS documentation and</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">manuals, but there&#39;s a lot 
of work to do, and we can always use more</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">volunteers.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The OpenAFS Admin Reference 
Manual has been converted to manual pages</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">(written in POD), and significant 
work has been done to update them and</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">write additional entries for 
new commands.  The current manual pages can</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">be found in OpenAFS CVS in 
the doc/man-pages directory and have been</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">shipped with all recent OpenAFS 
releases.  doc/man-pages/README contains a</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">list of work that still needs 
to be done, and all of the manual pages</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">would benefit from further 
review and editing.  Additionally, we need a</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">volunteer to work on automating 
the process of converting these manual</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">pages to HTML and hooking that 
into the process for generating the OpenAFS</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">web site.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The other OpenAFS manuals have 
been converted to Docbook, but now need</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">cleanup, updates for all the 
changes since OpenAFS 1.0, removal of</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">obsolete information, and removal 
of additional IBM-specific sections,</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">language, and assumptions.  
The QuickStart Guide is our first priority,</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">but work on any of the manuals 
is welcome.</font> <br>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The protocol documentation 
which we received from IBM in PDF format has</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">been converted to Microsoft 
Word .DOC files.  These documents need to be</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">further converted to Docbook, 
be reformatted, and have the Table of</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Contents and Index sections 
rebuilt using the appropriate tags. After</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">this work is complete, the 
OpenAFS developers can work to update the</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">documentation to match the 
current implementation.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Work on OpenAFS&#39;s documentation 
is coordinated on the</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><a href="mailto:openafs-doc@openafs.org" target="_blank">openafs-doc@openafs.org</a> mailing 
list.  Before starting work on a large</font>
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman">project, please mention the 
work on that mailing list so that we can</font>

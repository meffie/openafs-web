  <h1>OpenAFS Newsletter - November 2007</h1>

<p><i>An Update to the OpenAFS Community 
compiled by the Advisory Council</i></p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The OpenAFS Newsletter is intended to 
be a regular communiqu&eacute; from the OpenAFS Elders to the community of OpenAFS 
administrators and end users.&nbsp; In these newsletters the Elders will 
summarize the activities of the OpenAFS community, the progress that has been 
achieved in OpenAFS development, and outline the road map of future development 
that could be accomplished with the availability of sufficient resources. It is 
hoped that these newsletters will strengthen the community and foster additional 
dialogues and participation.</p>

<h1>Council of Elders Monthly Meeting</h1>

<p>The OpenAFS Advisory Council met on 
November 13.&nbsp; The following topics were discussed in the meeting:&nbsp; 
Development, AFS &amp; Kerberos Best Practices Workshop, Documentation, and OpenAFS 
communications.&nbsp; Minutes of the meeting can be found at:&nbsp;
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.openafs.org/pages/elders/minutes-20071113.html">

<h1>Council of Elders - Member Resignation</h1>

<p>Warren Yenson has resigned from the 
OpenAFS Council of Elders because he is no longer actively involved in OpenAFS 
development or with OpenAFS customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Warren had been closely 
involved with OpenAFS in his position at Morgan Stanley, but he has not been 
involved with AFS in his position at Google.&nbsp; The Council of Elders would 
like to thank Warren for his contributions to OpenAFS and wish him well in the 
future.</p>

<h1>OpenAFS Development Update</h1>

<p>Below is a summary of recent OpenAFS development activity.</p>

<p><u>UNIX/Linux Servers</u></p>

<ul type="DISC">

  <li>1.4.5 packages have been uploaded to 
	Debian.</li>

  <li>The 1.4 backport of the Kerberos 
	multiple-realm patch will be pulled into the Debian packages so that it can 
	be more broadly tested.</li>

  <li>There will be additional work to 
	improve Documentation, including Russ committing pending contributions from 
	Jason Edgecomb.</li>

  <li>Stanford and Sine Nomine are 
	persuing a file server problem that&#39;s causing periodic segfaults due to an 
	apparent free list corruption.&nbsp; Once this bug is identified and fixed, 
	it should be included in a 1.4.6 release.</li>

  <li>Russ is going to try to get some 
	resources at Stanford to start testing the demand-attach fileservers.</li>

</ul>
	<p><u>UNIX/Linux Clients</u></p>

<ul type="DISC">

  <li>OpenAFS 1.4.5 was released and 
	includes support for Leopard, Solaris 10-update 4, and new Linux support.</li>

  <li>Bug fixes proposed for 1.4.6 include 
	verifying viced-accurately-track-file<WBR>-callbacks-20071112 fixes the bug 
	seen with CBFree/FEFree corruption, viced-missing-lock-20071109, 
	libafsrpc-makefile-fix-20071110 for RPMS, linux-nsec-timestamp-zero<WBR>-20071106, 
	linux-splice-support-2007-1106 and solaris-nevada-update-2007<WBR>-1101, 
	linux-afs-unlinked-file-dentry<WBR>-flagging-20071031, and various Mac and 
	RPM packaging files.</li>

  <li>Pending work includes module unload 
	cleanup, afs_HashOutDCache panic, and an Rx error.</li>

  <li>Longer term, there is work planned 
	to stabilize 1.5 so that we are able to put out 1.6 series releases.&nbsp; 
	There has also been discussion with the HePiX community regarding a timeout 
	issue which limits AFS throughput.&nbsp; Derrick is working with Rainer 
	Toebbicke regarding his Rx test tool to resolve this matter.&nbsp; He is 
	also working with Hartmut Reuter to integrate his AFS OSD code.&nbsp; 
	However, the timing of this work depends on the availability of resources.</li>

</ul>

	<p><u>Windows Clients</u></p>

<p>There have been three OpenAFS for 
Windows releases since the last Elders meeting:&nbsp;OpenAFS 
<a href="https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-announce/2007/000206.html">1.5.25 (9/20/07)</a>,
<a href="https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-announce/2007/000212.html">1.5.26 (10/23/07)</a>,
<a href="https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-announce/2007/000215.html">1.5.27 (11/7/07)</a>.</p>

<p>The following work is changes have been 
made post 1.5.27::</p>

<ul type="DISC">

  <li>Optimization of the performance of 
	the Windows cache manager.</li>

  <li>A new option which permits .readonly 
	callbacks to be automatically renewed prior to expiration.&nbsp; This option 
	can reduce load on .readonly volumes over long periods of time. However, it 
	is an optional feature since it will resulte in a single FetchStgatus 
	request being sent per .readonly volume whether or not the client is 
	actively using that volume.</li>

</ul>
	<p>Future work plans for OpenAFS Windows 
Development include:</p>

<ul type="DISC">

  <li>OpenAFS Redirector work (in 
	progress)</li>

  <li>OpenAFS File System Filter Driver 
	that will permit \\AFS to be used without requiring the presence of the 
	Microsoft Loopback Adapter.</li>

  <li>Implementation of Extended 
	Attributes by storing data in the Apple Double Files as described in RFC 
	1740.</li>

</ul>

<h2>In-depth Focus on Ongoing Development:&nbsp; Documentation</h2>

	<p>Work is slowly proceeding on improving 
the OpenAFS documentation and
manuals, but there&#39;s a lot of work to do, 
and we can always use more
volunteers.</p>

<p>The OpenAFS Admin Reference Manual has 
been converted to manual pages

(written in POD), and significant work has 
been done to update them and

write additional entries for new commands.&nbsp; 
The current manual pages can

be found in OpenAFS CVS in the
doc/man-pages directory and have been

shipped with all recent OpenAFS releases.&nbsp; 
doc/man-pages/README contains a

list of work that still needs to be done, 
and all of the manual pages

would benefit from further review and 
editing.&nbsp; Additionally, we need a

volunteer to work on automating the 
process of converting these manual

pages to HTML and hooking that into the 
process for generating the OpenAFS

web site.

</p>

<p>The other OpenAFS manuals have been 
converted to DocBook, but now need

cleanup, updates for all the changes since 
OpenAFS 1.0, removal of

obsolete information, and removal of 
additional IBM-specific sections,

language, and assumptions.&nbsp; The 
Quick Start Guide is our first priority,

but work on any of the manuals is welcome.</p>

<p>The protocol documentation which we 
received from IBM in PDF format has

been converted to Microsoft Word .DOC 
files.&nbsp; These documents need to be

further converted to DocBook, be 
reformatted, and have the Table of

Contents and Index sections rebuilt using 
the appropriate tags. After

this work is complete, the OpenAFS 
developers can work to update the

documentation to match the current 
implementation.</p>

<p>Work on OpenAFS&#39;s documentation is 
coordinated on the

<a href="mailto:openafs-doc@openafs.org" target="_blank">
openafs-doc@openafs.org</a> mailing list.&nbsp; Before starting work on a large

project, please mention the work on that 
mailing list so that we can

avoid duplicating effort.

</p>

<h2>AFS &amp; Kerberos Best Practices Workshop</h2>

	<p>The 2008 Workshop will be held at NJIT 
in Newark, NJ, the week of May 19-23, 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a block of 
rooms available at Newark Penn Station Hilton.&nbsp; For more information on the 
workshop, please visit: <a href="http://workshop.openafs.org/afsbpw08/" target="_blank">

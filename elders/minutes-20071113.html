  <p><font size="2" face="Helv"><b>OpenAFS Meeting Summary - November 
13, 2007 </b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Helv"><b>Attendees</b>:  Russ Allbery, 
Jeffrey Altman, Derrick Brashear, Todd DeSantis, Laura Stentz, Warren 
Yenson.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Helv"><b>Gatekeeper Reports</b> - Russ Allbery, 
Jeffrey Altman, and Derrick Brashear sent out gatekeeper reports to 
the Council of Elders on 11/13/07, in advance of the meeting.  
A summary of their reports appears below:</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Helv"><u>Derrick Brashear (UNIX Development)</u></font> <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">OpenAFS 1.4.5 was released 
  and includes support for Leopard, Solaris 10-update 4, and new Linux 
  support.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">Bug fixes proposed for 1.4.6 
  include verifying viced-accurately-track-file<WBR>-callbacks-20071112 fixes 
  the bug seen with CBFree/FEFree corruption, viced-missing-lock-20071109, 
  libafsrpc-makefile-fix-20071110 for RPMS, linux-nsec-timestamp-zero<WBR>-20071106, 
  linux-splice-support-2007-1106 and solaris-nevada-update-2007<WBR>-1101, 
  linux-afs-unlinked-file-dentry<WBR>-flagging-20071031, and various Mac and 
  RPM packaging files.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">Pending work includes module 
  unload cleanup, afs_HashOutDCache panic, and an Rx error.  </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">Longer term, there is work 
  planned to stabilize 1.5 so that we are able to put out 1.6 series releases.  
  There has also been discussion with the HEPiX community regarding a 
  timeout issue which limits AFS throughput.  Derrick is working 
  with Rainer Toebbicke regarding his Rx test tool to resolve this matter.  
  He is also working with Hartmut Reuter to integrate his AFS+Object Storage 
  code.  However, the timing of this work depends on the availability 
  of resources.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="2" face="Helv"><u>Jeffrey Altman (Windows Development)</u></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Helv">There have been three OpenAFS for Windows 
releases since the last Elders meeting:  OpenAFS 1.5.25 (9/20/07), 
1.5.26 (10/23/07), and 1.5.27 (11/7/07).  Details of these releases 
can be found at <a href="http://openafs.org" target="_blank">openafs.org</a>. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Helv">The following changes have been made post 
1.5.27:</font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">Optimization of the performance 
  of the Windows cache manager.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">A new option which permits 
  .readonly callbacks to be automatically renewed prior to expiration.  
  This option can reduce load on .readonly volumes over long periods of 
  time. However, it is an optional feature since it will result in a single 
  FetchStatus request being sent per .readonly volume whether or not the 
  client is actively using that volume.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="2" face="Helv">Future work plans for OpenAFS Windows 
Development include:</font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">OpenAFS Redirector work (in 
  progress)</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">OpenAFS File System Filter 
  Driver that will permit \\AFS to be used without requiring the presence 
  of the Microsoft Loopback Adapter.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">Implementation of Extended 
  Attributes by storing data in the Apple Double Files as described in 
  RFC 1740.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="2" face="Helv"><u>Russ Allbery (Debian &amp; Documentation)</u></font> <br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">1.4.5 packages have been uploaded 
  to Debian.  </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">The 1.4 backport of the Kerberos 
  multiple-realm patch will be pulled into the Debian packages so that 
  it can be more broadly tested.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">There will be additional work 
  to improve Documentation, including Russ committing pending contributions 
  from Jason Edgecomb.  </font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">Stanford and Sine Nomine are 
  pursuing a file server problem that&#39;s causing periodic segfaults due 
  to an apparent free list corruption.  Once this bug is identified 
  and fixed, it should be included in a 1.4.6 release.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Helv">Russ is going to try to get 
  some resources at Stanford to start testing the demand-attach fileserver.</font></li>
</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="2" face="Helv"><b>Council of Elders - Member Resignation</b></font> <br>

not been involved with AFS in his position at Google.   However, 
Warren has kindly offered to talk with the Google Android team members

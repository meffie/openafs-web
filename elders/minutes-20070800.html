<h1>OpenAFS Monthly Newsletter - August 2007</h1>

<p><i>A Monthly Update to the OpenAFS Community compiled by the Advisory Council</i></p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is the first of what is 
intended to be a monthly communiqu&eacute; from the OpenAFS Elders to the 
community of OpenAFS administrators and end users.  In these newsletters 
the Elders will summarize the activities of the OpenAFS community, the 
progress that has been achieved in OpenAFS development, and outline 
the road map of future development that could be accomplished with the 
availability of sufficient resources. It is hoped that these newsletters 
will strengthen the community and foster additional dialogues and participation.</p>

<h1>Advisory Council Meeting</h1>
<p>The OpenAFS Advisory Council 
met on June 26.  The following topics were discussed in the meeting: 
Development, AFS &amp; Kerberos Best Practices Workshop, Web Site Design, 
and OpenAFS communications.  Minutes of the meeting can be found 
at:  <a href="http://www.openafs.org/elders/" target="_blank">http://www.openafs.org/elders/</a></p>

<h1>Recent Releases</h1>
<h2><i>Product Releases</i></h2>
<h3>UNIX, Linux &amp; MacOS X Development</h3>
<p>The following have been areas 
of recent activity for OpenAFS on UNIX and MacOS X:<br>
</p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li>Integration work 
  on rxgk with Love H&ouml;rnquist &Aring;strand.</li>
  <li>Continued integration 
  work on demand attach fileserver with updates form Tom Keiser.</li>
  <li>Merging of advancements 
  from Community, including fixes for AIX 5.3, Solaris 10+, and MacOS

  changes in MacOS 10.4).</li>
  <li>Patches are almost 
  ready for a 1.4.5pre1.</li>
  <li>There is a bug remaining 
  in the file server in 1.5.x which still needs to be resolved. 
  When this is done, we will start to consider stable releases for the 
  1.6 series.</li>
  <li>There is also some 
  work ongoing on the disk cache.</li>
  <li>There has been a 
  lot of activity around the Debian packages.  Several patches have 
  been committed, after verification on Zephyr.  </li>
  <li>There are several 
  fixes for Linux required on 1.4.4, and 1.4.5 will be going out soon. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Microsoft Windows Development</h3>
<br>
<p>We have issued five releases 
of OpenAFS for Windows in the past three months:<br></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li>1.5.16 - DST updates</li>
  <li>1.5.17 - Improved 
  NAT behavior</li>
  <li>1.5.18 - Minor bug 
  fixes</li>
  <li>1.5.19 - Denial 
  of Service vulnerability; many integrated logon improvements</li>
  <li>1.5.20 - drop boxes; 
  automatic fake stat when the user has no read privileges</li>

  performance optimizations</li>
</ul>
<h2>AFS &amp; Kerberos Best Practices 
Workshop</h2>
<br>
<p>The AFS &amp; Kerberos Best 
Practices Workshop was held at SLAC from May 7-11.  The keynote 
was entitled &quot;AFS Best Practices in the Business Context&quot; 
and was given by Mike Potek of Pictage, Inc.  Mike provided a 
compelling story of AFS usage within a global business whose distributed 
storage is growing at a very rapid rate. <br></p>
<p>Most of the presentations (including 
the keynote presentation) from the workshop can be found at:

<h2><b><i>Web 
Site Design</i></b></h2>
<br>
<p>The OpenAFS Elders have a machine 
up and running at Stanford which is intended to be used for hosting 
a new customer focused web site. There is still much work to do on content 
design.  Sine Nomine Associates has offered to volunteer a graphic 
artist / web designer.  However, before this resource can be effectively 
used, the Advisory Council needs to develop the site content, navigation 
design and site mapping. </p>
<h2>Documentation Improvement</h2>
<p>There was discussion of the 
need for improvement of the OpenAFS documentation during the Best Practices 
Workshop. Thanks to Simon Wilkinson, the OpenAFS documentation is improving. 
However, the manuals still need quite a lot of cleanup.  If anyone 
is interested in helping with this project, please contact Russ Allbery.</p>
<h2>Case Study of the Month 
- Pictage, Inc.  </h2>
<p><a href="http://www.pictage.com/" target="_blank"><u>http://www.pictage.com/</u></a></p>
<p>Pictage is a worldwide provider 
of services to wedding photographers who upload the photos they have 
taken. Pictage then makes the photos available to the wedding party 
for photo selection and printing.  Photos selected for printing are retouched 
by hand using Adobe Photoshop.  Pictage uses OpenAFS to store all 
of the original photos, the processed photos, and the web content. 
Work flow is managed by the use of mount points and symlinks which are 
placed within directories assigned to various photographers and their 
associated events.  </p>
<p>Pictage storage has exceeded 
200TB of data and more then 40 million files.  They frequently push the 
limits of the AFS directory structures running into the directory entry 
limitations.  Directory search performance is one of their bottlenecks. 
Unlike more modern file systems, AFS does not use a B+ tree representation 
and directory searches within the case-insensitive Microsoft Windows 
client are linear in nature.  This wastes significant CPU utilization 
and clock time.  Pictage had measured the performance loss on a duo-core 
Xeon processor at between 3 and 5 seconds to open a file in Adobe Photoshop 
when the directory contains 15,000 entries, because Adobe Photoshop 
will request information forthe last 30 files it has seen, thus requiring 
heavy usage of AFS directories.  OpenAFS for Windows 1.5.13 added an 
optimization for cached files with registered callbacks that avoids 
the performance problem for files that are known to exist.  With this 
optimization in place, Pictage experienced file open times similar to 
those experienced when opening files on the local filesystem.  For files 
that do not exist such as Java class files, the optimization does not 
apply, and the linear search must still be used.<br></p>
<p>Number of simultaneous users: 
150 AFS client users; 1000 web server users<br>
Amount of data in AFS: Approx 215TB<br>
Amount of AFS storage: 265TB with planned growth to 425TB in twelve 
months<br>
Number of volumes: Approx 800,000.<br>
Number of files: Approx 200 000 000.<br>
Number of file servers: 70 with 10 more planned<br>
Approx storage per server: depending on age of server 1.2TB to 25TB </p>
<p>(statistics as of 22 May 2007)</p>

OpenAFS Security Advisory 2016-001

Topic: ptserver allows foreign users to create arbitrary groups
       CVE-2016-2860
       

Issued: 16 March, 2016
Affected: OpenAFS server versions prior to 1.6.17
          IBM AFS servers

Foreign users can bypass access controls to create groups as
system:administrators, including in the user namespace and the
system: namespace.

SUMMARY
=======

The Kerberos authentication protocol is used to control access to
AFS services.  Modern AFS deployments use Kerberos 5, though previous
versions used Kerberos 4 or a native service similar to Kerberos 4
called kaserver, but both Kerberos 4 and kaserver are now considered
insecure.  Kerberos deployments ("realms") are usually local to a
single site, but two realms can cooperate and create a cross-realm
key or keys that permit users from one site to authenticate to
services in the other.

The AFS-3 protocol includes a facility wherein users from foreign realms
can be added to groups and other access control lists in a local cell;
these foreign users are identified by the '@' symbol in their names,
separating the username and the name of the remote realm.  In order to
avoid burdening the local cell administrators with having to manually
create entries in the protection database for foreign users, a
self-registration facility is present whereby a CreateUser request
can be authenticated by the foreign principal whose user entry is being
created.

A bug in the implementation of the self-service registration caused
requests from foreign users to be handled as if the creator and owner
were system:administrators.  Since administrators can bypass many
restrictions on group creation, this allows the foreign user to create
groups in the system: namespace or user namespace (with no colon), and
the group quota is not enforced for these requests.

The newly created groups are owned by system:administrators, so the
attacker is not able to modify them after creation.

IMPACT
======

An AFS cell that authenticates against a Kerberos realm that
shares crossrealm keys with any other Kerberos realms is vulnerable
to the creation of AFS groups with arbitrary names.  Any attacker
that controls a Kerberos principal in the foreign realm can create
an arbitrary number of AFS groups, owned by system:administrators.
These groups can conflict with the namespace used for user names,
and with the system:-prefixed family of groups.

The attacker only needs a Kerberos principal from the foreign
realm; a foreign user entry in the protection database is not needed.
Running the ptserver in the "restricted mode" that prevents creation
of cross-realm users will not mitigate the attack.

Sites that use a separate service to manage users and groups that
synchronizes with AFS, such as the Moira server that emerged from
Project Athena, are subject to additional impact.  An attacker that
knows the name of a group (or user) that will be created in the future
can pre-create the new group and cause a disparity between AFS and the
external service.  Several variations are possible once the AFS group
for the target name has been created, such as creating an
attacker-controlled list of a different name, renaming it to the target
name, adding attacker-controlled entities to the list via the external
service, then renaming the list away again.  This will leave the
attacker-controlled entities in the AFS group for when the external
service attempts to create the AFS group for the target name,
potentially leading to a loss of confidentiality or integrity if the
target group is later used for access control.


AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS prior to 1.6.17 are affected.  Additionally,
all releases of AuriStor prior to 0.110 are affected, and IBM AFS
is affected.

FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade all servers
to OpenAFS 1.6.17 (Unix).  Additionally, patch files are provided for
the master and 1.6.x branches.

The ptservers will need to be restarted in order for the fixes to
take effect.

DETAILS
=======

IBM AFS 3.3 supported foreign-cell users as a build-time option, on by
default.  The foreign user entries in the prdb could be created via a
self-service RPC, as the ptserver would detect the foreign principal
authenticating the request and allow creation of the remote user entry
from an otherwise unprivileged principal.  By the time of the OpenAFS
1.0 import, this code was enabled unconditionally.

In order to have these foreign user prdb entries recorded with actual
extant creator and owner IDs, the creator and owner fields are set to
system:administrators when the creator in the request is from a foreign
realm, since the ID for the user being created is not known until later
in the process.  This is the first step in the newEntry() RPC handler,
and unfortunately, the creator reassignment is done for all requests
from foreign principals, not just self-creation requests.

The next step in creating a new PTS entry is to call the function
CreateOK(), which performs some basic sanity checking on the type of
request being handled, but does not perform detailed access control
checking.  This function restricts the creation of user entries to
administrators, but permits all authenticated users to create group
entries, since each user has their own group namespace.  When the
newEntry() RPC handler calls CreateOK() for requests from foreign users,
the parameter for "acting as administrator" is set only when the name to
be created matches the name of the authenticated client, permitting user
self-registration but denying other user creation requests.  All group
creation requests succeed at the time of CreateOK(), since regular users
are normally allowed to create groups in their own namespace or other
users' namespaces, so processing continues with  the creator and owner
IDs set to system:administrators.

Later on, when actually creating the group, access checks intended to
restrict user-created groups to the group namespace of their owner are
bypassed because the creator has been set to system:administrators.
Administrators are permitted to create groups with arbitrary names, and
are not charged a group quota when creating groups.

As a result, unprivileged foreign users can create groups that
unprivileged users from the local cell would not be able to create.  It
is not possible for foreign users to create user entries.  It is not
possible for foreign users to create groups with specific group IDs,
since creation of groups with specific ID values occurs via a different
RPC that does not permit foreign-user registration.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

The patches were developed by Jeffrey Altman and Benjamin Kaduk, with
assistance from Jeffrey Hutzelman and Simon Wilkinson.  Jeffrey
Hutzelman and Nickolai Zeldovich contributed to the analysis of the bug.

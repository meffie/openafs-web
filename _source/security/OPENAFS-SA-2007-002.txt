Topic: Denial of Service Vulnerability in OpenAFS for Windows clients

Issued:		19-Apr-2007
Last Update:	19-Apr-2007
Affected:	OpenAFS 1.3.64 - 1.3.99, 1.4.0 - 1.4.4, 1.5.0 - 1.5.18
                when MIT Kerberos for Windows (any version) is installed

A user with the ability to alter the contents of the default 
Kerberos v5 configuration profile can prevent Microsoft Windows from 
successfully booting.

SUMMARY
=======

OpenAFS for Windows installs a Network Provider module, afslogon.dll, which
is loaded by the Windows Logon service, winlogon.exe.  When MIT Kerberos for
Windows is installed, afslogon.dll will attempt to perform operations that
involve the Kerberos v5 libraries.  Successful use of Kerberos v5 requires 
the ability to establish a krb5_context.  Parsing errors in the Kerberos v5
configuration profile, krb5.ini, will prevent the successful creation of a 
krb5_context.  afslogon.dll attempts to free a krb5_context whether or 
not it was successfully established.  This produces a memory access error that 
in turn forces the Windows Logon Service to terminate unexpectedly and causes
Microsoft Windows to halt.

There are no known publicly-available exploits for this vulnerability at
this time.

IMPACT
======

An attacker (or misguided user) by damaging the contents of the Kerberos v5
configuration profile can prevent Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, 2003, and Vista
from successfully booting even in safe mode.  Booting from CD and 
replacing the Kerberos v5 configuration profile is required to correct the 
condition.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS for Windows 1.3.64 and above.
All releases of OpenAFS for Windows 1.4.x, up to and including OpenAFS 1.4.4.
All releases of OpenAFS for Windows 1.5.x, up to and including OpenAFS 1.5.18.

OpenAFS for non-Windows platforms are unaffected.

FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that users with versions of OpenAFS for
Windows older than 1.5.19 upgrade to 1.5.19 or above.

The latest OpenAFS for Windows release is always available from 
http://www.openafs.org/windows.html.

For those who are unable to upgrade, removal of afslogon.dll from the 
%WinDir%\System32 directory can be used as a workaround.  The side effects
of doing so include no support for integrated logon and the possibility
that users will be able to logon prior to the AFS client service reaching
a ready state.

DETAIL
======
OpenAFS for Windows builds a static library, afskfw.lib, which includes all 
of the logic for obtaining AFS tokens from arbitrary Kerberos v5 identities,
managing Kerberos v5 ticket caches and Kerberos v5 ticket renewals.  Within
this library are two locations in which krb5_free_context() can be called 
with a NULL pointer.  The MIT Kerberos libraries do not validate the input 
parameter and proceed to use the data pointed to by the NULL pointer as a 
valid krb5_context.  krb5_free_context() proceeds to free memory for data 
structures referred to by the krb5_context and generates an invalid memory
access exception.  

afskfw.lib is linked into afscreds.exe, afssrvmgr.exe, and afslogon.dll.  
An invalid Kerberos v5 configuration profile with damage to either the 
[libdefaults] or [realms] sections (and perhaps others) will prevent the
generation of a krb5_context from krb5_init_context().  

The afslogon.dll Network Provider module is loaded by the Windows Logon 
Service regardless of whether or not integrated logon is in use.  A failure
to create a valid krb5_context will result in process termination.  The
failure of the Windows Logon Service process forces Microsoft Windows to 
halt, producing a blue screen.

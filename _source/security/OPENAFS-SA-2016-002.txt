OpenAFS Security Advisory 2016-002

Topic: information leakage from client memory

Issued: 16 March, 2016
Affected: OpenAFS client versions prior to 1.6.17

The contents of uninitialized memory are sent on the wire when
clients perform certain RPCs.  Depending on the RPC, the information
leaked may come from kernel memory or userspace.

SUMMARY
=======

The AFS-3 filesystem service is built upon a collection of UDP remote
procedure calls (RPCs).  Some RPCs provide very general interfaces,
allowing for various attributes or fields to be queried or set by the
client in a single call, with a bitmask indicating which field(s) the
client is requesting.  The client still sends the entire RPC-L structure
on the wire, but the server, correctly, only examines those fields
indicated in the bitmask.  In some cases, the client was only
initializing the fields corresponding to the bits it set in the bitmask,
leaving uninitialized memory in the other portions of the structure it
sends to the server.  In some cases, this uninitialized memory comes
from the kernel stack and thus leaks kernel memory; in other cases, the
information comes from the userspace stack.

IMPACT
======

Small quantities (at most a few tens of bytes per call) of information
from kernel memory or a long-running userspace process could be revealed
to an observer on the network or the remote server.  This could
potentially cause a loss of confidentiality for user data or leak
information about the memory layout in the kernel or a long-running
process.  Learning information about the memory layout, such as the
value of a valid pointer, can be used in certain remote attacks that
exploit other vulnerabilities, especially when attempting to bypass
Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS prior to 1.6.17 are affected.

FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade all servers
to OpenAFS 1.6.17 (Unix).  Additionally, patch files are provided for
the master and 1.6.x branches.

Clients will need to be restarted in order for the fixes to take effect.

DETAILS
=======

The following data structures are impacted:

AFSStoreStatus
AFSStoreVolumeStatus
VldbListByAttributes
ListAddrByAttributes

The affected cases for AFSStoreStatus are: when setting file attributes;
creating files, directories, or symlinks; and writing using the
standalone afsio or afscp tools.

The affected cases for AFSStoreVolumeStatus are when a cache manager is
used to adjust a volume's quota (i.e., with fs setquota or equivalent).

The affected cases for VldbListByAttributes are: when the backup
coordinator is evaluating a volume set, when a fileserver is
synchronizing its list of volumes with the VLDB, when a client is
listing VLDB entries, and when a client is unlocking a volume in the VLDB.

The affected cases for ListAddrByAttributes are: when libadmin is
querying server information, when the standalone cacheout utility is
listing servers, and when the standalone vlclient utility is querying
server information.

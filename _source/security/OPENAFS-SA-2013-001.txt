OpenAFS Security Advisory 2013-001

Topic: Buffer overflows in OpenAFS fileserver
       CVE-2013-1794

Issued:		27 Feb 2013
Last Updated:	27 Feb 2013
Affected:	OpenAFS servers before version 1.6.2

An attacker with the ability to manipulate AFS directory ACLs may crash the
fileserver hosting that volume. In addition, once a corrupt ACL is placed
on a fileserver, its existence may crash client utilities manipulating ACLs
on that server.

SUMMARY
=======

By carefully crafting an ACL entry an attacker may overflow fixed length 
buffers within the OpenAFS fileserver, crashing the fileserver, and 
potentially permitting the execution of arbitrary code. To perform the
exploit, the attacker must already have permissions to create ACLs on the
fileserver in question.

Once such an ACL is present on a fileserver, client utilities such as 'fs'
which manipulate ACLs, may be crashed when they attempt to read or modify
the ACL.

IMPACT
======

An authenticated attacker may crash, or run arbitrary code, on an OpenAFS 
fileserver, or a client connected to such a serever

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS prior to 1.6.2

FIXES

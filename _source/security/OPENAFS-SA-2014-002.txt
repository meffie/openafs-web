Topic: Use of uninitialized memory in OpenAFS fileserver
       CVE 2014-4044

Issued:         12-June-2014
Last Update:    12-June-2014
Affected:       OpenAFS file servers running version 1.6.8

An attacker with the ability to connect to an OpenAFS fileserver
over the network can trigger the use of uninitialized memory and,
potentially, execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the fileserver process.

Clients are not affected.

SUMMARY
=======

The 1.6.8 release of the OpenAFS fileserver and dafileserver
processes introduced a security vulnerability in the host package
due to the use of uninitialized memory allocations from the process
heap.


IMPACT
======

New client connections to the fileserver can result in unexpected
termination of the service.  As a side-effect of service termination
callback state information and data not yet flushed to disk can be
lost.

An attacker with the ability to connect to an OpenAFS fileserver over
the network can trigger the use of uninitialized memory and,
potentially,  execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
fileserver process.


AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

The fileserver and dafileserver executables in release 1.6.8 of OpenAFS
only. Clients and database server processes are unaffected.


FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators of fileservers upgrade
to OpenAFS version 1.6.9 or newer.

For those sites unable, or unwilling, to upgrade a patch which resolves this
issue is available directly from:

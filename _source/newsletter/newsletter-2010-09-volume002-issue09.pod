=head1 OpenAFS Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 9, September 2010

Welcome to the September issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. This newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community.

As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com> know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter. Any news about AFS-related projects is welcome
and may be submitted to Jason for inclusion in the next newsletter.

The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at
L<http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/>

=head2 General OpenAFS Progress

The voting for the chairs of the afs3-standardization group is closed.
Preliminary results show Hartmut Reuter and Doug Engbert as the two chairs
of the AFS Protocol Standardization group. As the candidate with the most
votes, Hartmut will serve a full two-year term and Doug will serve a
one-year half-term. Official results will be confirmed later.

1.5.77 was released on September 8.  It may be downloaded from
L<http://www.openafs.org/release/openafs-1.5.77.html> 1.5.77 includes some
changes to the RPM packaging where the demand-attach and traditional
fileserver binaries are both included in the same RPM.

The 1.6 branch was created in git on August 17. The 1.6 branch name is
openafs-stable-1_6_x.

Marc Dionne verified that OpenAFS no longer produces lots of log noise in
RedHat Enterprise Linux 6 Beta. L<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=584901>

=head2 Case Study - PDC

In this issue, I would like thank Harald Barth from the Center for Parallel
Computing at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden for
being profiled in the newsletter. --Jason

Jason: What is the name of your organization?

Harald: Our organization is the Center for Parallel Computing at the Royal
Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. The swedish abbreviation is
"PDC". The numbers given are for our center only because I do not have
accurate numbers for other AFS cells at kth.se. There are at least 3 other
AFS cells than pdc.kth.se at the Royal Institute of Technology.

Jason: What does it do?

Harald: PDC does provide High Performance Computing for academic users in
Sweden and within joint projects within the EU.

Jason: How many users does your site have?

Harald: 1600, approx 250 active.

Jason: How many cells do you have?

Harald: pdc.kth.se. Some of the users have home directories in nada.kth.se.

Jason How many full-time and part-time people are responsible for AFS
support and in what capacity?

Harald: First line helpdesk 1.5 persons, can give basic support. More
complicated problems take part of my time.

Jason: How much data do you store in AFS?

Harald: 27TB

Jason: Do you use contractors or vendors to augment your workforce?

Harald: Rarely

Jason: How do you use OpenAFS?

Harald: All users have $HOME in AFS. AFS is used for all storage with the
exeption of some HPC data which is in Lustre and some Cern Tier 1 storage
which is in their storage solution.

Jason: What type of network bandwidth is there between your client and
servers?

Harald: 1Gbit, starting to experiment with 10Gbit. But of course there may
be clients somewhere else in the world with less bandwidth.

Jason: How many servers do you have?

Harald: Too few (as HPC researchers normally do not realize how much I/O
their programs actually utilize). The current number is 12, hopefully more
servers in the future, not to increase space but to increase throughput
and availability.

Jason: Are they in different locations? How far apart are they?

Harald: Within the same building.

Jason: How spread out are your users? Same city, region, country?

Harald: Country. The size of Sweden/Europe RTT to the furthest users is
around 15ms. Typical users are closer than 5ms.

Jason: Are your users spread all over Sweden? Europe? how many kilometers
away are your users?

Harald: Most users are of course locally, but we have never restricted
access from any other place on the Internet. As my users live and work
over all of Sweden, they access their data from their desktop computers as
well. Sweden is about the area and form of CA (slightly larger, but the
extreme north of Sweden is not populated anyway ;-). It's approximate
900km from Stockholm to my most northern university users in Lule√•. Other
users in Europe are more rare, not because they can not access the data
through AFS but because they normally use scp anyway.

Jason: Do you use any other network storage to supplement AFS, like
dropbox, or windows shares?

Harald: Lustre, if a file system only visible within one cluster
classifies as "network storage".

Jason: Is AFS the only networked filesystem that you use?

Harald: See above.

Jason: If not, what are the others, and how do they compare/contrast? Why
do you use the other filesystems?

Harald: Lustre is in some aspects faster, but has by far not as good
uptime as AFS.

Jason: Is your investment in AFS increasing or decreasing?

Harald: Increasing, but not as much as investments in Lustre.

Jason: Is there anything else that you would like to say?

Harald: Recently, PDC aquired a Cray cluster which runs some SuSE modified
by Cray. It is our intention to bring AFS to that system, but so far we
have not aquired enough information about the internal to make it happen.

=head2 Events

=head3 European AFS Conference

The European AFS & Kerberos Conference 2010 took place in Pilsen, Czech
Republic, from September 13 to September 15. The conference was hosted by
Centre for Information Technology, University of West Bohemia.  The
conference was friendly and well-organized.

A summary of the conference will be included in next month's newsletter.
The slides are available at L<http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/agenda.php> and
the pictures are here:

=head2 AFS Protocol Standardization

Informal drafts that haven't been uploaded to the IETF web site:

Rx Spec:

L<http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html>

This draft is in the very early stages. Mike Meffie and Tom Keiser are the
current owners of this proposal. A formal specification of Rx is needed as
a basis for other IETF proposals.

Discussion on these proposals is welcome and should be done on the
AFS3-standardization list at
L<http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization>

=head3 PTS Alternate Authentication

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names>

Status: Seventh Draft

Last update: August 31, 2010

I hope it's done.

The Kerberos 5 name type has been removed; The GSSAPI name type with
the Kerberos OID will be used for all Kerberos 5 users. Consensus
seems near.

--Derrick

=head3 AFS Callback Extensions

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo>

Status: Active - Waiting on RPC refresh

The callback draft is stable.  There is a published implementation. My
understanding is that it is accepted with the requirement that it be
adjusted to use RPC refresh data types, which means AFSFetchStatus64 and
the new 100ns time data type.  This is regarded as "trivial" but at the
same time, the spec can't be standardized as is.  It is planned for merge
in, IIRC, 1.9/1.10.

--Matt Benjamin

=head3 RXGK

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk>

Status: Active

Rxgk is a security layer for AFS which will support strong encryption and
authentication through Kerberos v5, GSI and any other GSSAPI security
mechanism.

Changes which are considered suitable for the 1.5.x series are in git -
look for changes with author sxw@your-file-system.com. A development tree,
which will be frequently re-based, is at
http://github.com/your-file-system/openafs-rxgk

Last Update: Jan 9, 2010

=head3 AFS3 ACL Rights

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions>

Status: Second draft

Last update: January 13, 2010

We're waiting for the afs3-standardization structure to solidify before
proceeding with this. So, no progress right now.

--Andrew Deason

=head3 Rx Security Object Providing Cleartext Peer Identity Assertions

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear>

Status: Third draft

Last Update: April 17, 2010

I released a new version of the Rx Clear security class I-D the other
day.  I am hereby soliciting comments on this new version of the
draft.

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear>

The major changes in this version of the document are:

=over

=item *

new introductory section that better explains the relationship
between Rx and AFS-3 so that the document is more approachable for
novices

=item *

additional prose in the security considerations section which better
explains how this security object changes the attack vectors, as well
as a brief mention of securing rxnull/rxclear with IPsec

=item *

flesh out the AFS assigned numbers registrar section with formal
specifications for each newly requested registry

=item *

change the endpoint identifier type enumeration from 32-bits to
8-bits, as the larger size seemed quite wasteful

=item *

mark several security header fields as reserved for future use

=item *

I added a number of informative references to Transarc and CMU ITC
tech reports

=head3 AFSVol Tag-Length-Value Remote Procedure Call Extensions

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv>

Status: Fourth Draft

Last Update: August 4, 2010

The other week I submitted a new draft to the IETF which implements
the aforementioned changes (as well as a few others).  The new draft
is available at the following URLs:

=back

The complete revision history is as follows:

=over

=item *

split unsigned 64-bit type down into several more descriptive types
that allow the TLV data stream to be more self-describing.

=item *

add a signed 64-bit integer type to allow for relative timestamps

=item *

now that we have more descriptive types, use them in a number of places

=item *

change AFSVOL_TLV_TAG_VOL_TRANS_CALL_VALID into a boolean type payload

=item *

make sure rxgen can parse the XDR in the appendix

=item *

make sure generated C code compiles and links

=item *

add in-text cites for AFS3-VVL, AFS3-FSCM, DAFS, and OSD.

=item *

provide motivations for GetCapabilities RPC

=item *

provide protocol semantic definitions for each newly allocated capability bit

=item *

allocate AFSVOL_TLV_FLAG_MORE bit to notify caller when we can't
send all tags due to AFSVOL_TLV_TAG_MAX length limit

=back

Any comments or feedback are appreciated.

=head3 AFS Byte-Range File Locking

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mbenjamin-afs-file-locking>

Status: Fifth Draft

This draft proposes protocol extensions to support byte-range and
mandatory locking.

The first draft was submitted on May 5, 2010.

A fix for improving startup times with a large number of volumes was
submitted to gerrit (2648), as have a couple of small fixes related to
setting -vhashsize (2649, 2650). The fix for salvaging attached volumes
(2329) and the fix to conditionally run fssync-debug (2480) have still not
been merged, but getting them in will be worked on shortly. Some
prerequisites for salvageserver improvements have been merged (2250,

Self-intro:

By the last newsletter, basics of chunking and extents had been
implemented along with basic file functions of
Reading/Writing/Moving/Removing and metadata file creation/deletion.

Present focus is to integrate the code with hcrypto library port in
OpenAFS.  As the port still dinkering in terms of usablity I am presently
working on some working patches in gerrit to adapt my code to use the
hcrypto library.

After this integration is complete, the task will be to manage user keys.

<h1><a name="openafs_newsletter__issue_3__july_2009">OpenAFS Newsletter, Issue 3, July 2009</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the third issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. The newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community. The main thing to
report in this issue is the conversion of CVS to git. Git is now ready for
use in development. I suspect that many people were very busy or on
vacation this month, because many of the subprojects did not reply to
requests for project updates.</p>
<p>As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe &lt;<a href="mailto:jason@rampaginggeek.com">jason@rampaginggeek.com</a>&gt; know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter.</p>
<p>The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at

<h2><a name="general_openafs_progress">General OpenAFS Progress</a></h2>
<p>Many thanks go to Simon Wilkinson for finishing the conversion from CVS to
git and setting up gerrit. Gerrit has only been up for a week and there
are already over 100 patches that have been merged!</p>
<p>1.4.11 has been released, and it includes major bugfixes for Linux clients
and fileservers. Some minor bugs were fixed on other platforms. The
release notes are available at
<a href="http://www.openafs.org/frameset/dl/openafs/1.4.11/RELNOTES-1.4.11">http://www.openafs.org/frameset/dl/openafs/1.4.11/RELNOTES-1.4.11</a></p>

<h3><a name="afs_hackathon">AFS Hackathon</a></h3>
<p>The School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh will be hosting
an AFS Hackathon 22-24 September (immediately before the European AFS
Conference). All OpenAFS developers are welcome to attend - please see the
email to openafs-announce for details, and RSVP to <a href="mailto:sxw@inf.ed.ac.uk">sxw@inf.ed.ac.uk</a></p>

<h3><a name="annual_best_practices_workshop">Annual Best Practices Workshop</a></h3>
<p>Plans are already underway for the seventh Workshop, to be held May 24-28,
2010, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  We hope to see
you there.</p>

<p>During the week of 6th July, we completed our transition to the git
version control system. Git, and gerrit (our code review tool) are now
ready for use! See
<a href="http://www.dementia.org/twiki/bin/view/AFSLore/GitDevelopers">http://www.dementia.org/twiki/bin/view/AFSLore/GitDevelopers</a> for more

</li>
</ul>
<p>The pthreaded ubik's initial code delivery to provide for use of POSIX
threads instead of LWPs was made in April 2008.  After some production
usage, some problems were found in initialization (on certain platforms)
and lack of locking, leading to data corruption in some cases for the
vlserver.  As part of the analysis of these problems, some differences
were identified between the private version of OpenAFS being used and the
version in OpenAFS HEAD, several other longstanding issues with vos,
vlclient, and the vlserver were identified, and some patches have been
submitted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>RT #124977 addresses mutex and condition variable initialization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RT #125035 fixes a longstanding logging bug</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RT #125036 fixes a longstanding bug in vlclient command-line parsing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Current work involves cleaning up and testing a patch to fix improper
handling of multi-homed IP addresses in the VLDB.  The patches to fix the
logging are undergoing further testing and analysis (both code review and
automated testing with Helgrind), and we hope to have those submitted soon
as well.</p>

<h2><a name="resolved_tickets">Resolved Tickets</a></h2>
<p>Since Gerrit is now the preferred method of accepting patches instead of
RT, it's likely that fewer RT tickets will be filed.</p>

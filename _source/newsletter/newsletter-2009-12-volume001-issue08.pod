=head1 OpenAFS Newsletter, Issue 8, December 2009

Welcome to the eighth issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. This newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community.

As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com> know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter. Any news about AFS-related projects is welcome
and may be submitted to Jason for inclusion in the next newsletter.

The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at
L<http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/>

I hope everyone enjoys the holidays.

=head2 General OpenAFS Progress

OpenAFS 1.5.68 was released on December 8. Key highlights include dynamic
server ranking based on network conditions and support for more than 128
fileserver threads.

Disk cache performance on Fedora 12 may be poor because of IMA support in
the kernel. Using a memory cache or recompiling the kernel to disable IMA
support are workarounds. Fixing this in the long-term may require
reworking how the disk cache accesses files.

Mike Meffie pointed out that a fileserver lockup was fixed recently. Bug
124097 was fixed commit 416e2f11c35f5d55f91090b30b4db1a9bf6d6e0 which was
pulled into the 1.4.x branch and should make it into the next 1.4.x
release.

=head2 Events

=head3 Annual Best Practices Workshop

Plans are already underway for the seventh Workshop, to be held May 24-28,
2010, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  We hope to see
you there.

=head3 European AFS Conference

The date for the 3rd European AFS & Kerberos Conference has been set. The
conference will take place in Pilsen, Czech Republic, from September 13 to
September 15, 2010. More details are forthcoming and will be posted at
L<http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz>.

=head2 AFS Protocol Standardization

Informal drafts that haven't been uploaded to the IETF web site:

Rx Spec:

L<http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html>

Discussion on these proposals is welcome and should be done on the
AFS3-standardization list at
L<http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization>

=head3 PTS Alternate Authentication

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names-00>

Status: Active - Second call for review

As before, I've written up a draft based on the 2004 Stockholm AFSig
hackathon discussion of the PTS alternate authentication names proposal,
as modified based on further feedback and the 2009 Edinburgh Hackathon.
Comments welcome and encouraged.

=head3 AFS Callback Extensions

L<http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo-00.txt>

Status: Active - Needs more discussion

We need to decide whether we're going to wait for the RPC refresh changes
before publishing extended callbacks. My belief is that that's the only
factor currently delaying this document. The question here, essentially,
is whether anyone would deploy extended callbacks before deploying updated
RPCs. To date, nobody has said they would do so.

=head3 DNS SRV Resource Records for AFS

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records-01>

Status: Last Call before IETF submission

=over

This is a last call for any further feedback, corrections, or comments on
draft-allbery-afs-srv-records-01 before I ask about advancing it as an RFC
independent submission.  The current text is available at:

L<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records>

Please send any further comments before December 14th.  If I have not
heard anything by that point that seems to question consensus on this
document, I will approach the Application Area ADs and ask their opinion
about whether to proceed as an independent submission as an informational
RFC or whether they feel this should be standards track for any reason.
(I suspect that informational is correct since AFS is not an IETF
protocol, but I want to ask just in case.)

The fix for 124484 (volserver salvages) in gerrit 786/787 has been a
little delayed from trying to agree on new volume package APIs, but
progress is being made. Another notable DAFS change undergoing review is
in gerrit 880, which can dramatically speed up salvages. DAFS developer
documentation is being actively worked on, and should be available
sometime soon.

Project Description:

During the developement of a web-interface for AFS (still in progress, see
"AFS access through the web", "European AFS meeting 2009"), we found that
the use of PAGs (shared between threads) to keep credentials forces
inefficient choices in the development of some applications
(e.g. authenticated web services), so we switched to a more fine grained
"credential pointer", named AG, that can be associated to just a thread.

Current Status:
We have a sample implementation for Linux based on openafs 1.4, stable
enough for our in house development; we are planning the porting to
openafs 1.5.

There is a tiny Java wrapper (jni) that provides access to the 'AG'
functionality so that tokens are associated to single threads,
of course we also wrapped ktc_SetToken to authenticate in java.

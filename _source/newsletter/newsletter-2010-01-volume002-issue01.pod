=head1 OpenAFS Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 1, January 2010

Welcome to the ninth issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. This newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community.

As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com> know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter. Any news about AFS-related projects is welcome
and may be submitted to Jason for inclusion in the next newsletter.

The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at

=head2 General OpenAFS Progress

Some discussion took place about which configure and command-line options
should be changed before the code is branched for 1.6. The archive is at
L<http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-info/2009-December/032494.html>.
Based on this discussion, Simon Wilkinson submitted patches to enable
bos-restricted mode at compile-time, remove the --disable-large-fileserver
configuration option, always enabled AFSDB support inclients, and always
have the "vos listvol" command show full output. These patches were
accepted and merged into the master git branch.

Code cleanup: Russ Allbery fixed all compiler warnings regarding
supergroups onthe i386 platform. Some warnings remain on x86_64 platforms.

Simon's patch to tone down the warnings about syscall probing was accepted
into the 1.4.x branch and will be in the next 1.4 release.

1.4.12 release candidate 1 was released on January 12. Testing and
feedback is encouraged. Please report any success or failures on the
openafs-into or openafs-devel email lists. Bug reports are greatly
appreciated.

=head2 Events

=head3 Annual Best Practices Workshop

Plans are already underway for the seventh Workshop, to be held May 24-28,
2010, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  We hope to see
you there.

Web site: L<http://workshop.openafs.org/afsbpw10/index.html>

The deadline for proposals is February 1:

=head3 European AFS Conference

The date for the 3rd European AFS & Kerberos Conference has been set. The
conference will take place in Pilsen, Czech Republic, from September 13 to
September 15, 2010. More details are forthcoming and will be posted at
L<http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz>. The conference is being hosted by Centre for
Information Technology, University of West Bohemia.

=head2 AFS Protocol Standardization

Informal drafts that haven't been uploaded to the IETF web site:

Rx Spec:

L<http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html>

Discussion on these proposals is welcome and should be done on the
AFS3-standardization list at
L<http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization>

=head3 PTS Alternate Authentication

L<http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names-00>

Status: Active - Third call for review

Third call for review; I'm gonna ask for a last call later in the
month as so far all review comment has been incorporated, unless
something comes up.

--Derrick Brashear

=head3 AFS Callback Extensions

L<http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo-00.txt>

Status: Active - Needs more discussion

We need to decide whether we're going to wait for the RPC refresh changes
before publishing extended callbacks. My belief is that that's the only
factor currently delaying this document. The question here, essentially,
is whether anyone would deploy extended callbacks before deploying updated
RPCs. To date, nobody has said they would do so.

--Simon Wilkinson

=head3 DNS SRV Resource Records for AFS

L<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records>

Status: Submitted to IETF

The IESG has received a request from an individual submitter to consider
the following document:

- 'DNS SRV Resource Records for AFS '
  <draft-allbery-afs-srv-records-03.txt> as a Proposed Standard

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send substantive comments to the
ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by 2010-02-05. Exceptionally, comments may be
sent to iesg@ietf.org instead. In either case, please retain the beginning
of the Subject line to allow automated sorting.

Please note that the document has a Normative Downreference to RFC 1183,
which is an Experimental RFC.

The file can be obtained via
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records-03.txt

IESG discussion can be tracked via
https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/pidtracker.cgi?command=view_id&dTag=190

=head3 RXGK

I've just pushed a new version of the RXGK draft to the Internet Drafts
repository. I believe that this draft addresses all of the comments I've
received to date, and all of the issues raised at the Edinburgh Hackathon.

Implementation is likely to start shortly - review would be greatly
appreciated!

=head3 AFS3 ACL Rights

L<http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions-01.txt>

Status: Second draft

Andrew Deason has published an IETF draft to provide a common document for
discussion of the proposed new ACL rights to prevent users with admin
rights on a folder from giving rights to system:anyuser.

Bug 124484 (volserver salvages) has finally been fixed, and with that,
we are aware of no open DAFS-specific bugs that are critical for
production use. The salvager optimization in gerrit 880 is being
partially reworked to better accommodate changes in volume/partition
locking which is currently in progress. Parts of the new developer
documentation have been completed, and should be public soon.

I've released cm updates for FreeBSD RELENG_8, most are committed; number
of outstanding cm issues is shrinking; a 9-CURRENT update will follow.

I have updated patches for a NetBSD cm port rebased from OpenBSD's ,
though result isn't 100% working cm, it's a...big improvement.  Will send
soon for consideration.

I understand extended callbacks to be not blocked, but is complicated

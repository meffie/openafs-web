<h2>Contribution Definition Draft for discussion</h2>
For the purposes of membership, the Membership Committee of the OpenAFS Foundation defines a contribution as:
<ul>
<li>A substantial code submission, as defined by the gatekeepers but expected to represent a half-hour of work or more for an average developer.</li>
<li>A substantial documentation submission, as defined by the gatekeepers but expected to represent a half-hour of work or more for an average developer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The membership committee may also treat, at its discretion, substantial work on testing, bug reporting with sufficient detail to identify the problem, substantial work on bug triage, or substantial assistance with other foundation activities such as workshops or support infrastructure for the OpenAFS free software development and releases as contributions for the purposes of membership.

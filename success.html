<h2>OpenAFS Success Stories</h2>

<p>We're using the OpenAFS client code pretty extensively, and
have been since fairly early in its release cycle.  We're running the
OpenAFS client on all of our Windows lab machines (we cheered the day the
Windows clients became available, since we'd never found the funding to put
Transarc clients on our Windows machines, and since the students had been
clammoring for access to their AFS home directories for quite a while).
We're also using the OpenAFS client on our MacOS X systems, although it
will be summer before we actually roll out OS X in our campus lab
environments.  We've recently started a publicity campaign on campus to get
students and faculty to take advantage of the OpenAFS client installation
on their personal computers wherever possible, viewing AFS access from
desktop systems throughout the campus as one of the primary ways to move
toward decomissioning insecure FTP access to our central facilities -- we
find that running AFS clients on desktop systems greatly simplifies our
users' use of web development tools like DreamWeaver, since with the
client, they can publish changes directly into their AFS home directories.
</p><p>
On the whole, we've had very few problems with the client -- most of
them related to the installer or to versioning issues with earlier versions
of the code.  We're still working on completing our integration work with
Windows 2000 and XP -- we've established cross-realm trust between our
nascent Active Directory and our existing K5 realm, and we've been working
on trying to arrange to have AFS tokens derived locally from the K5 tickets
granted to users on our Windows systems at login time.  So far, that's not
worked quite as well as we'd hoped, but that's purely a Windows problem,
not an OpenAFS problem -- we've worked around it with some simple scripting
at the client end for now, but I'm hopeful that when we get a chance to do
some more developement work over the summer, we may find a means to make
tokenization transparent on our Win2K/XP systems.
</p><p>
We're hoping to do some testing early in the summer with the OpenAFS
server, and provided that we can get everything to work out, to start
migrating our server farm from the Transarc server code to the OpenAFS
server code.  We've been using AFS at our site since the early 1990s and we 
have a modestly-large AFS cell comprising Solaris servers of various vintage
(Solaris 2.6, mostly, with some Solaris 8 on our more recent acquisitions).

Our cell runs on OpenAFS fileservers on Tru64 5.0a. We have 0.5 - 1 TB of data
and about 250-400 clients. We are VERY pleased with the fileserver, it's quite stable, no crashes in the 6 months we've been running them.
</p><p>
Our 15 Solaris clients are running OpenAFS, we are very pleased with
this one. (We plan to have about 100 Solaris hosts in a few months.)

<dt>Chris Huebsch, volunteer administrator for Dr. Wilhelm Andre Gymnasium, Chemnitz, Germany, shared:</dt>

<p>
I first used AFS in 1995 during my first year as a student. Now I am a
member of the academic staff at Chemnitz University of Technology.
Two years ago I started helping the Dr. Wilhelm Andre Gymnasium
(Gymnasium is the German word for high school) to build up their
computer lab. At that time we had only 30 workstations and one server
using NFS.
</p><p>
Last year (2001) we were very lucky and got enough money to build up a large
intranet. At least large for a school. We now have 4 fileservers (each
with 400 GB hardware RAID) with a total of 1.6 TB AFS space. Normal
school-installations have to live with 50 to 100 GB on Windows NT or Novell.
</p><p>
We have 1500 users and 100 clients (the next 50 clients are in sight).
The primary platform is Linux. Some workstations run Windows 2000 for 
the sake of legacy applications.
</p><p>
Before OpenAFS, we used NFS and Samba. There were no real problems with that
solution because we had very little filespace (20 GB) on one
server. But we saw the problems arising with 4 servers and much more
capacity: The load on the server would rise and there was no transparent
way to reorganize the location of the directories without heavy work on
the users side due to absolute path names in configuration files!
Neither NFS nor Samba provide ACLs in a smooth way. It would have required 
patching and installing lots of additional software. And quotas are not really
easy to use. And last but not least: AFS is just cool :-)
</p><p>
OpenAFS saves us a lot of time. This starts with the installation of our
workstations via RedHat KickStart and NFS. Installing 100 clients in
parallel (each requiring about 1.5 GB of binaries) produced an
insustainable load on one server. So we decided to create an install
volume and have it replicated on each AFS server. Each AFS Server
machine runs a NFS re-exporter. With a round robin DNS-entry for the
NFS installation server we can quadruple the capacity of our install
source without writing cryptic KickStart configurations.
</p><p>
Of course all the well known benefits of AFS (automatic backups, fault
tolerance, etc.) help us save a lot of time and stress.
</p><p>
One of the school specific problems with AFS is that we need an operation
mode for our workstations and servers allowing users to log in using
AFS authentication, but without allowing access to the home volumes of 
the users. We need this mode for writing "electronic tests". We try to solve 
this with negative ACLs for a special test-writing-group.
</p><p>
The next problem is to distribute some of the rights of
system:adminstrators without making users members of that group. For
instance we like to give teachers the right to change quotas of their
puplis' volumes but not their own. We think we will solve this with a
middle-layer web page.
</p><p>
At the moment we do not buy any commercial support. But we are trying to extend
our cell through the whole city with 160 sites and 50000 users. At that
time we will need some help.

<p>
Computing Services rolled out OpenAFS to both clients and servers early, and now runs modern versions on Solaris 2.6 servers, as well as on Solaris 7 and 8 and locally-updated Redhat 6.1 clients. Additionally, the OpenAFS Windows NT client is being tested general rollout.</p>
<p>
Despite often using pre-release versions of the software few problems have been experienced, and fixes have generally been quickly forthcoming, either internally done and contributed back to the community, or thanks to the many active contributors to the ongoing success of the project.

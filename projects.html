<h1>Pending and desired OpenAFS projects</h1>

<p>This page describes some of the projects that are currently known to be in 
progress or discussed within the OpenAFS development community.&nbsp; This list 
is by no means complete.&nbsp; Additional sources of information regarding 
on-going and future plans can be found on the <a href="roadmap.html">road map</a> 
and the <a href="gsoc.html">Google Summer of Code</a> pages.</p>
<h2>Pending projects</h2>
The following are items known to be in progress, and, where available, a point of contact.
<dl>
<dt>Hierarchical Storage Management Integration</dt>
<dd><p>Provide support for storing AFS files into a HSM system (DMF is
the first targeted HSM system).  Contact Ken Hornstein
(kenh@cmf.nrl.navy.mil) for more information.  This project
has been made possible in part by support from SGI.
</p></dd>
<dt>Disconnected AFS Operations</dt>
<dd><p>Provides the ability to use AFS while not connected to a network. 
Significant work was completed during the 2008 Google Summer of Code and 
currently resides in the OpenAFS Git repository as part of the 
openafs-devel-1_5_x branch.&nbsp; The current implementation is functional for 
read/write volume operations but cannot support hard linked objects.&nbsp; There 
is also no method of pinning objects to the cache or applying conflict 
resolution policies if the content of the volume on the file changes while the 
disconnected client modified the same objects.&nbsp; Contact Simon Wilkinson 
(sxw@inf.ed.ac.uk) for more information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>FreeBSD port</dt>
<dd><p>Server ported. Cache manager support is not yet complete.</p>
</dd>
<dt>NetBSD port</dt>
<dd><p>Server ported. No timeline available.</p>
</dd>
<dt>OpenBSD port</dt>
<dd><p>In progress. Cache manager works but not recommended for production use.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Better Documentation</dt>
<dd><p>In progress. On-going projects have produced a complete set of new
<a href="http://www.openafs.org/manpages/">man pages</a>, a replacement for the 
Unix Quick Start Guide, and progress on a new Administrator's Guide.&nbsp; Contact Russ Allbery if you'd like to contribute</p>
</dd>
<dt>Kerberos v5 and multiple encryption types</dt>
<dd><p>In progress. Add Kerberos v5 and additional encryption type support. Contact Marcus Watts or Matt Benjamin</p>
<dt>RxUDP Improvements</dt>
<dd><p>In progress. Your File System Inc. was awarded a SBIR grant to improve 
the performance characteristics of the Rx RPC mechanism.&nbsp; During Phase I 
many implementation deficiencies were corrected and maximum throughput was 
raised from 60MB/second to 240MB/second.&nbsp; </p></dd>
<dt>RxTCP</dt>
<dd><p><a href="http://workshop.openafs.org/afsbpw06/talks/kenh-rxtcp.pdf">In progress.</a> 
Implement Rx API on top of TCP/IP in order to gain performance on high speed 
networks and improve the behavior of AFS across firewalls and network address 
translators.&nbsp; Ken Hornstein began the effort.&nbsp; Contact Jeffrey Altman 
for additional information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>HostAFSd</dt>
<dd><p>In progress. Implement an AFS server that exports portions of the local file system to AFS clients.  Contact Derrick Brashear.
</dd>
<dt>Native Windows file system support</dt>
<dd><p>In Progress.&nbsp; Implement AFS as a Windows Network Redirector and File System Filter instead of as a virtual SMB server.&nbsp; 
Contact Jeffrey Altman and Peter Scott for additional information.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Better server preference support</dt>
<dd><p>In progress.&nbsp; Allow selectable continuous or on-demand server preferences in clients based on available information about Rx connection round trip times instead of classful networking approach currently used.&nbsp; 
This project is being worked on by Jacob Thebault-Spieker as a 2009 Google 
Summer of Code project.&nbsp; Contact Derrick Brashear (shadow@dementia.org)</p>

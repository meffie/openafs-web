<h1>OpenAFS is Migrating Away From Single DES; kaserver is Deprecated</h1>
<p>AFS version 3 was designed and implemented during the late 80s and early
90s when the state of the art in distributed computer authentication and
data security was Kerberos 4 and single DES. The RXKAD security class
was specified to use a single DES key and the kauth authentication
protocol is a derivative of MIT's Kerberos 4 protocol.</p>

<p>For the better part of the last decade there has been concern regarding
the cryptographic strength of the DES cipher when used as a building
block within systems intended to prove authentication and/or data
integrity and privacy.  Kerberos 4 and RXKAD are not extensible and
cannot negotiate non-DES key types.  As a result efforts to migrate away
from Kerberos 4 based authentication at higher risk organizations have
been underway since the mid to late 90s.  Ken Hornstein issued the first
of his Kerberos 5 migration kits for AFS in May 1999.</p>

<p>In March 2003, the continued use of single DES and kauth as the basis
for OpenAFS security became a real-world threat when a significant
Kerberos 4 crossrealm vulnerability was published.  The OpenAFS
community was notified in security advisory OPENAFS-SA-2003-001 which
can be found at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.openafs.org/security">http://www.openafs.org/security</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of the mounting concerns regarding the strength of DES, NIST
announced in May 2003 the withdrawal of FIPS 43-3 &quot;Data Encryption
Standard (DES)&quot; as well as the associated FIPS 74 and FIPS 81.  In other
words, NIST announced that DES and its derivatives could no longer be
used by the United States Government and should no longer by those that
trust its lead.</p>

<p>In July 2003 MIT announced the end of life of the Kerberos 4 protocol
which is distributed for backward compatibility as part of the MIT
Kerberos 5 distribution.  A copy of that announcement can be found at
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb4-end-of-life.html">http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb4-end-of-life.html</a>.</p>

<p>Since then the OpenAFS gatekeepers and the development community
have continued to strengthen the support for Kerberos 5.  By 1.2.11
protocol support for the use of Kerberos 5 tickets within the rxkad
security class was complete for all of the Kerberos 5 DES enctypes.
As part of the OpenAFS 1.4 series integrated support for aklog
and asetkey as well as support for the large Kerberos 5 tickets
generated by Microsoft's Active Directory were added.</p>

<p>With the release of 1.4, OpenAFS can be used with Kerberos 5 KDCs
without any externally supported packages other than the Kerberos 5
library.  Either MIT or Heimdal Kerberos 5 libraries can be used to
build the support tools.  For the KDC, you can use any Kerberos 5 KDC
implementation (MIT, Heimdal, Microsoft Active Directory, ...)</p>

<p>The 2004, 2005, and 2006 workshops contained presentations from
various organizations on how to migrate your cell to Kerberos 5
or install a new cell using Kerberos 5 in place of kaserver.
The 2005 and 2006 workshops had one day tutorials on Kerberos 5
installation, configuration, and administration.</p>

<p>With this historical foundation in place, the OpenAFS Elders are
officially announcing the deprecation of kaserver and endorsing the following 
roadmap for transitioning from single DES to stronger ciphers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<du>
 <li>Effective immediately, kaserver releases will log a warning
   at startup stating that kaserver support has been deprecated and
   that a migration to a Kerberos 5 solution should begin.</li>

 <li>Before the 1.6 release, the build system will be modified to
   optionally enable OpenAFS without kaserver.</li>

 <li>After the 1.6 release, the build system will be modified to build
   OpenAFS without kaserver unless it is specifically requested.</li>

 <li>The OpenAFS Elders encourage volunteers to assist in updating the
   OpenAFS documentation to include instructions on installing or
   migrating to Kerberos 5 KDCs (MIT, Heimdal, Active Directory, ...)</li>

 <li>The OpenAFS Elders endorse the development of new PAM AFS solutions
   maintained outside the OpenAFS source tree.</li>

 <li>The OpenAFS Elders endorse the development of the rxk5 and rxgk
   security classes in order to enable the use of Kerberos 5 ciphers
   other than single DES for both authentication and data security
   between AFS clients and servers.</li>

 <li>When OpenAFS is capable of supporting Kerberos 5 with non-DES
   ciphers the major version number will be changed to &quot;2&quot;.</li>

 <li>The kaserver will be removed from the source tree no sooner than one
   year after the OpenAFS 2.0 release.</li>

 <li>The rxkad security class will become deprecated no sooner than one
   year after the OpenAFS 2.0 release.  It will first be disabled by
   default on clients, then disabled by default on servers, and
   eventually it will be removed from the source tree.  Further details
   will be announced as part of the OpenAFS 2.0 release.</li>
</du>
</blockquote>
<p>If a significant security hole is identified in either kaserver or DES
prior to its removal from the OpenAFS source tree, the OpenAFS Elders
reserve the right to accelerate this time table.</p>


<p>Signed, the OpenAFS Elders.</p>

<title>OpenAFS Foundation Details</title>
</header>
<body>
<h2>Details and rationale</h2>
<ol>
<li>What name to incorporate under? Probably the "OpenAFS Foundation", unless trademark issues make this untenable.</li>
<li>Where to incorporate? New York City area, for central location among large users and easy access for international participants in likely meetings.</li>
<li>Initial list of board members: (Who?) Future board members will be elected by the members.</li>
<li>Contributor agreement: Mozilla (code grant, no additional rights) or Perl (grant of rights)? The latter could be used to allow us to relicense to another OSI-compliant license without needed each submission to be relicensed. But it's likely to be not palatable.</li>
<li>Initial list of members: consists of currently active contributors (have had code or documentation change committed in the past 12 months). Membership to others is granted based on a recommendation by two existing voting members, to individuals who have made at least two contributions to the project (code or doc patches, implementation, etc.), and have submitted a signed contribution agreement. Advisory board members are deemed to have made two contributions.</li>
<li>Sponsor members gain membership by a yearly donation. Different sizes of donation will have different benefits, and the top tier of sponsor members have seats on the Advisory Board. Sponsor members are not voting members. (Though companies who are sponsor members might have employees who are voting members.)</li>
<li>First election would be proposed for 11/1/2009</li>

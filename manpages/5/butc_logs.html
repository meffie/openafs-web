<p>butc_logs - Message logs from the Tape Coordinator process</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The Backup System Tape Coordinator (<b>butc</b>) process generates two log files per device,
one for error messages and one for actions.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Error_Message_Log"
>Error Message Log</a></h2>

<p>The <em>TE_<i>device_name</i></em> file logs error messages generated by the Backup System Tape Coordinator that controls the tape device or backup data file indicated by <i>device_name</i>.</p>

<p>As the Tape Coordinator initializes,
it creates the file in ASCII format in the <em>/usr/afs/backup</em> directory.
If there is an existing file,
the Tape Coordinator renames it to <em>TE_<i>device_name</i>.old</em>&#62;,
overwriting the existing <em>TE_<i>device_name</i>.old</em>&#62; file if it exists.</p>

<p>For a tape device,
the Tape Coordinator derives the variable <i>device_name</i> portion of the filename from the device pathname listed in the local <em>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</em> file,
by stripping off the initial <code>/dev/</code> string and replacing any other slashes in the name with underscores.
For example,
the filename for a device called <em>/dev/rmt/4m</em> is <em>TE_rmt_4m</em>.
Similarly,
for a backup data file the Tape Coordinator strips off the initial slash (<code>/</code>) and replaces any other slashes in the name with underscores.
For example,
the filename for a backup data file called <em>/var/tmp/FILE</em> is <em>TE_var_tmp_FILE</em>.</p>

<p>The messages in the file describe the error and warning conditions the Tape Coordinator encounters as it operates.
For instance,
a message can list the volumes that are inaccessible during a dump operation,
or warn that the Tape Coordinator is overwriting a tape or backup data file.
The messages also appear in the <em>/usr/afs/backup/TL_<i>device_name</i></em> file,
which traces most of the Tape Coordinator&#39;s actions.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Action_Log"
>Action Log</a></h2>

<p>The <em>TL_<i>device_name</i></em> file logs the actions performed by the Backup System Tape Coordinator that controls the tape device or backup data file indicated by <i>device_name</i>.
It also records the same error and warning messages written to the <em>TE_<i>device_name</i></em> file.</p>

<p>As the Tape Coordinator initializes,
it creates the file in ASCII format in the <em>/usr/afs/backup</em> directory.
If there is an existing file,
the Tape Coordinator renames it to <em>TL_<i>device_name</i>.old</em>,
overwriting the existing <em>TL_<i>device_name</i>.old</em> file if it exists.</p>

<p>For a tape device,
the Tape Coordinator derives the variable <i>device_name</i> portion of the filename from the device pathname listed in the local <em>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</em> file,

<p>fms.log - Records output from the fms command</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The <em>fms.log</em> file records the output generated by the <b>fms</b> command.
The output includes two numbers that can appear in a tape device&#39;s entry in the <em>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</em> file on the Tape Coordinator machine to which the tape device is attached:</p>

<ul><li><p>The capacity in bytes of the tape in the device.</p></li><li><p>The size in bytes of the end-of-file (EOF) marks (often referred to simply as <i>filemarks</i>) that the tape device writes.</p></li></ul>

<p>When transferring the numbers recorded in this file to the <em>tapeconfig</em> file,
adjust them as specified in <a href="../5/tapeconfig.html" class="podlinkman"
>tapeconfig(5)</a>,
to improve Tape Coordinator performance during dump operations.</p>

<p>If the <em>fms.log</em> file does not already exist in the current working directory,
the <b>fms</b> command interpreter creates it.
In this case,
the directory&#39;s mode bits must grant the <code>rwx</code> (read,
write,
and execute) permissions to the issuer of the command.
If there is an existing file,
the command interpreter overwrites it,
so the file&#39;s mode bits need to grant only the <b>w</b> permission to the issuer of the <b>fms</b> command.
The <b>fms</b> command interpreter also writes similar information to the standard output stream as it runs.</p>

<p>The file is in ASCII format.
To display its contents,
log onto the client machine and use a text editor or a file display command such as the UNIX <b>cat</b> command.
By default,
the mode bits on the <em>fms.log</em> file grant the required <code>r</code> permission only to the owner (which is the local superuser <code>root</code> by default).</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="OUTPUT"
>OUTPUT</a></h1>

<p>The first few lines of the file provide a simple trace of the <b>fms</b> command interpreter&#39;s actions,
specifying (for example) how many blocks it wrote on the tape.
The final two lines in the file specify tape capacity and filemark size in bytes,
using the following format:</p>

<pre>   Tape capacity is &#60;tape_size&#62; bytes
   File marks are &#60;filemark_size&#62; bytes</pre>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="EXAMPLES"
>EXAMPLES</a></h1>

<p>The following example of the fms.log file specifies that the tape used during the execution of the <b>fms</b> command had a capacity of 2,136,604,672 bytes, and that the tape device writes filemarks of size 1,910,220 bytes.</p>

<pre>   fms test started
   wrote 130408 blocks
   Tape capacity is 2136604672 bytes
   File marks are 1910220 bytes</pre>

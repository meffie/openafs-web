<p>afs_volume_header - Represents an AFS volume</p>

>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The <em>V<i>vol_ID</i>.vol</em> file is the header file for the AFS volume with volume ID <i>vol_ID</i>.
There is one such file for each volume stored on an AFS server (<em>/vicep</em>) partition.
The header file stores information that includes the volume&#39;s name,
ID number,
type (read/write,
read-only,
or backup),
size and status (online,
offline,
or busy).
To display information from the header file,
use the <b>vos listvol</b> or <b>vos examine</b> command.</p>

<p>The header file points to,
but does not contain,
the actual data in the volume.
It is not possible to access the AFS data except by mounting the volume in the AFS filespace and reading its contents through the Cache Manager.</p>

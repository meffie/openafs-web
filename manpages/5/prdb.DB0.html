<p>prdb.DB0,
prdb.DBSYS1 - Contain the Protection Database and associated log</p>

>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The <em>prdb.DB0</em> file contains the Protection Database,
which maps AFS user,
machine,
and group names to their respective IDs (AFS UIDs and GIDs) and tracks group memberships.
The Protection Server (<b>ptserver</b> process) uses the information in the database to help the File Server grant data access to authorized users.</p>

<p>The <em>prdb.DBSYS1</em> file is a log file in which the Protection Server logs each database operation before performing it.
When an operation is interrupted,
the Protection Server replays the log to complete the operation.</p>

<p>Both files are in binary format and reside in the <em>/usr/afs/db</em> directory on each of the cell&#39;s database server machines.
When the Protection Server starts or restarts on a given machine,
it establishes a connection with its peers and verifies that its copy of the database matches the copy on the other database server machines.
If not,
the Protection Servers call on AFS&#39;s distributed database technology,
Ubik,
to distribute to all of the machines the copy of the database with the highest version number.</p>

<p>Always use the commands in the <b>pts</b> suite to administer the Protection Database.
It is advisable to create an archive copy of the database on a regular basis,
using a tool such as the UNIX <b>tar</b> command.</p>

<p>salvage.lock - Prevents multiple simultaneous salvage operations on a partition</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The <em>salvage.lock</em> file guarantees that only one Salvager (<b>salvager</b> process) runs at a time on a file server machine (the single process can fork multiple subprocesses to salvage multiple partitions in parallel).
As the Salvager initializes,
it creates the empty (zero-length) file in the <em>/usr/afs/local</em> directory and invokes the <b>flock</b> system call on it.
It removes the file when it completes the salvage operation.
Because the Salvager must lock the file to run,
only one Salvager can run at a time.</p>

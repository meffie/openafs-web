<p>BackupLog - Traces Backup Server operations</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The <em>BackupLog</em> file records a trace of Backup Server (<b>buserver</b> process) operations on the local machine and describes any error conditions it encounters.</p>

<p>If the <em>BackupLog</em> file does not already exist in the <em>/usr/afs/logs</em> directory when the Backup Server starts,
the server process creates it and writes initial start-up messages to it.
If there is an existing file,
the Backup Server renames it to <em>BackupLog.old</em>,
overwriting the existing <em>BackupLog.old</em> file if it exists.</p>

<p>The file is in ASCII format.
Administrators listed in the <em>/usr/afs/etc/UserList</em> file can use the <b>bos getlog</b> command to display its contents.
Alternatively,
log on to the machine and use a text editor or a file display command such as the UNIX <b>cat</b> command.
By default,
the mode bits on the <em>BackupLog</em> file grant the required <code>r</code> (read) permission to all users.</p>

<p>The Backup Server records operations only as it completes them,
and so cannot recover from failures by reviewing the file.
The log contents are useful for administrative evaluation of process failures and other problems.</p>

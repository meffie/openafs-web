<p>bdb.DB0,
bdb.DBSYS1 - Contain the Backup Database and associated log</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The <em>bdb.DB0</em> file contains the Backup Database,
which records configuration information used by the AFS Backup System along with cross-indexed records of the tapes created and volumes dumped using the Backup System commands.</p>

<p>The <em>bdb.DBSYS1</em> file is a log file in which the Backup Server (<b>buserver</b> process) logs each database operation before performing it.
When an operation is interrupted,
the Backup Server replays the log to complete the operation.</p>

<p>Both files are in binary format and reside in the <em>/usr/afs/db</em> directory on each database server machine that runs the Backup Server.
When the Backup Server starts or restarts on a given machine,
it establishes a connection with its peers and verifies that its copy of the <em>bdb.DB0</em> file matches the copy on the other database server machines.
If not,
the Backup Servers use AFS&#39;s distributed database technology,
Ubik,
to distribute to all of the machines the copy of the database with the highest version number.</p>

<p>Use the commands in the backup suite to administer the Backup Database.
It is advisable to create a backup copy of the <em>bdb.DB0</em> file on tape on a regular basis,
using the UNIX <b>tar</b> command or another local disk backup utility.</p>

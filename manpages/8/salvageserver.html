<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>In its typical mode of operation,
the <b>salvageserver</b> is a daemon process responsible for salvaging volumes.
It is a component of the <code>dafs</code> process type.
In the conventional configuration,
its binary file is located in the <em>/usr/afs/bin</em> directory on a file server machine.</p>

<p>The Salvageserver daemon is responsible for scheduling and executing volume salvage operations on behalf of client processes.
The fileserver acts as the primary salvageserver client: any failed volume attach operation results in a salvageserver scheduling request.
The salvageserver also accepts periodic volume activity messages in order to update its salvage request priority queue.
Other clients of the salvageserver daemon include the <b>salvsync-debug</b> utility,
and the salvageserver command itself by passing the <b>-client</b> flag.</p>

<p>The salvage operations performed on vice partition data are nearly identical to those performed by the standalone Salvager command.
The key differences between the two commands are:</p>

<ul><li><p>The Salvageserver is a daemon process which runs concurrently with the fileserver.
In contrast,
the Salvager is a stand-alone application which is invoked when the fileserver and volserver are not running.</p></li><li><p>The Salvageserver is incapable of performing whole partition salvage operations; it operates at volume group granularity.</p></li></ul>

<p>The Salvageserver normally creates new inodes as it repairs damage.
If the partition is so full that there is no room for new inodes,
use the <b>-nowrite</b> argument to bringing undamaged volumes online without attempting to salvage damaged volumes.
Then use the <b>vos move</b> command to move one or more of the undamaged volumes to other partitions,
freeing up the space that the Salvageserver needs to create new inodes.</p>

<p>By default,
multiple Salvageserver subprocesses run in parallel: one for each volume group.
By default,
four concurrent salvage operations are permitted.
You may alter this default by providing a positive integer value for the <b>-parallel</b> argument.
The maximum permitted value is 32 concurrent salvageserver subprocesses.</p>

<p>By default,
the salvageserver enables a heuristic which attempts to stop disk head thrashing by concurrent salvageserver subprocesses.
Unfortunately,
this heuristic significantly degrades performance in many cases.
In at least the following environments,
passing the <code>all</code> string to the <b>-parallel</b> argument is strongly encouraged:</p>

<ul><li><p>On NAMEI fileservers</p></li><li><p>When a vice partition is backed by multiple disks (e.g.
RAID)</p></li><li><p>When a vice partition is backed by SAN-attached storage,
LVM,
or some other form of storage virtualization which would cause unix device id numbers to be unpredictable.</p></li></ul>

<p>The Salvageserver creates temporary files as it runs,
by default writing them to the partition it is salvaging.
The number of files can be quite large,
and if the partition is too full to accommodate them,
the Salvageserver terminates without completing the salvage operation (it always removes the temporary files before exiting).
Other Salvageserver subprocesses running at the same time continue until they finish salvaging all other partitions where there is enough disk space for temporary files.
To complete the interrupted salvage,
reissue the command against the appropriate partitions,
adding the <b>-tmpdir</b> argument to redirect the temporary files to a local disk directory that has enough space.</p>

<p>The <b>-orphans</b> argument controls how the Salvageserver handles orphaned files and directories that it finds on server partitions it is salvaging.
An <i>orphaned</i> element is completely inaccessible because it is not referenced by the vnode of any directory that can act as its parent (is higher in the filespace).
Orphaned objects occupy space on the server partition,
but do not count against the volume&#39;s quota.</p>

<p>To generate a list of all mount points that reside in one or more volumes,
rather than actually salvaging them,
include the <b>-showmounts</b> flag.</p>

<p>This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command suites.
Provide the command name and all option names in full.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="OPTIONS"
>OPTIONS</a></h1>

<dl>
<dt><a name="[initcmd]"
>[<i>initcmd</i>]</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Accommodates the command&#39;s use of the AFS command parser,
and is optional.</p>

<dt><a name="-partition_&#60;name_of_partition_to_salvage&#62;"
><b>-partition</b> &#60;<i>name of partition to salvage</i>&#62;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the name of the partition to salvage.
Specify the full partition name using the form <em>/vicep<i>x</i></em> or <em>/vicep<i>xx</i></em>.
Omit this argument to salvage every partition on the file server machine.</p>

<dt><a name="-volumeid_&#60;volume_id_to_salvage&#62;"
><b>-volumeid</b> &#60;<i>volume id to salvage</i>&#62;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the volume ID of a specific read/write volume to salvage.
The <b>-partition</b> argument must be provided along with this one and specify the volume&#39;s actual site.</p>

<dt><a name="-debug"
><b>-debug</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This flag should be considered deprecated.
Its primary purpose was to disable forking and parallelization of the Salvager so that log messages were not interleaved.
Due to the manner in which <em>/usr/afs/logs/SalSrvLog</em> is written,
log messages from subprocesses are never interleaved; the entire log for a volume group salvage is appended to the master log as one atomic transaction.</p>

<dt><a name="-nowrite"
><b>-nowrite</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Brings all undamaged volumes online without attempting to salvage any damaged volumes.</p>

<dt><a name="-inodes"
><b>-inodes</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Records in the <em>/usr/afs/logs/SalSrvLog</em> file a list of all AFS inodes that the Salvageserver modified.</p>

<dt><a name="-force"
><b>-force</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Inspects all volumes for corruption,
not just those that are marked as having been active when a crash occurred.</p>

<dt><a name="-oktozap"
><b>-oktozap</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Removes a volume that is so damaged that even issuing the <b>vos zap</b> command with the <b>-force</b> flag is ineffective.
Use this argument only in consultation with AFS Development or Product Support.
Combine it with the <b>-partition</b> and <b>-volumeid</b> arguments to identify the volume to remove.</p>

<dt><a name="-rootinodes"
><b>-rootinodes</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Records in the <em>/usr/afs/logs/SalSrvLog</em> file a list of all AFS inodes owned by the local superuser <code>root</code>.</p>

<dt><a name="-salvagedirs"
><b>-salvagedirs</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Salvages entire directory structures,
even if they do not appear to be damaged.
By default,
the Salvageserver salvages a directory only if it is flagged as corrupted.</p>

<dt><a name="-blockreads"
><b>-blockreads</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Forces the Salvageserver to read a partition one disk block (512 bytes) at a time and to skip any blocks that are too badly damaged to be salvaged.
This allows it to salvage as many volumes as possible.
By default,
the Salvageserver reads large disk blocks,
which can cause it to exit prematurely if it encounters disk errors.
Use this flag if the partition to be salvaged has disk errors.</p>

<dt><a name="-parallel_&#60;#_of_max_parallel_partition_salvaging&#62;"
><b>-parallel</b> &#60;<i># of max parallel partition salvaging</i>&#62;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the maximum number of Salvageserver subprocesses to run in parallel.
Provide one of three values:</p>

<ul><li><p>An integer from the range <code>1</code> to <code>32</code>.
A value of <code>1</code> means that a single Salvageserver subprocess salvages the volume groups sequentially.
The disk partition heuristic (see above) based upon unix device ids is enabled.</p></li><li><p>The disk partition heuristic (see above) based upon unix device ids is disabled.</p></li><li><p>The string <code>all</code> followed immediately (with no intervening space) by an integer from the range <code>1</code> to <code>32</code>,
to run the specified number of Salvageserver subprocesses in parallel on volume groups.
The disk partition heuristic (see above) based upon unix device ids is disabled.</p></li></ul>

<p>If this argument is omitted,
up to four Salvageserver subprocesses run in parallel.</p>

<dt><a name="-tmpdir_&#60;name_of_dir_to_place_tmp_files&#62;"
><b>-tmpdir</b> &#60;<i>name of dir to place tmp files</i>&#62;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Names a local disk directory in which the Salvageserver places the temporary files it creates during a salvage operation,
instead of writing them to the partition being salvaged (the default).
If the Salvageserver cannot write to the specified directory,
it attempts to write to the partition being salvaged.</p>

<dt><a name="-showlog"
><b>-showlog</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Displays on the standard output stream all log data that is being written to the <em>/usr/afs/logs/SalSrvLog</em> file.</p>

<dt><a name="-showsuid"
><b>-showsuid</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Displays a list of the pathnames for all files that have the setuid or setgid mode bit set.</p>

<dt><a name="-showmounts"
><b>-showmounts</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Records in the <em>/usr/afs/logs/SalSrvLog</em> file all mount points found in each volume.
The Salvageserver does not repair corruption in the volumes,
if any exists.</p>

<dt><a name="-orphans_(ignore_|_remove_|_attach)"
><b>-orphans</b> (ignore | remove | attach)</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Controls how the Salvageserver handles orphaned files and directories.
Choose one of the following three values:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="ignore"
>ignore</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Leaves the orphaned objects on the disk,
but prints a message to the <em>/usr/afs/logs/SalSrvLog</em> file reporting how many orphans were found and the approximate number of kilobytes they are consuming.
This is the default if the <b>-orphans</b> argument is omitted.</p>

<dt><a name="remove"
>remove</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Removes the orphaned objects,
and prints a message to the <em>/usr/afs/logs/SalSrvLog</em> file reporting how many orphans were removed and the approximate number of kilobytes they were consuming.</p>

<dt><a name="attach"
>attach</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Attaches the orphaned objects by creating a reference to them in the vnode of the volume&#39;s root directory.
Since each object&#39;s actual name is now lost,
the Salvageserver assigns each one a name of the following form:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="__ORPHANFILE__.index_for_files."
><code>__ORPHANFILE__.<i>index</i></code> for files.
<dt><a name="__ORPHANDIR__.index_for_directories."
><code>__ORPHANDIR__.<i>index</i></code> for directories.</a></dt>
</dl>

<p>where <i>index</i> is a two-digit number that uniquely identifies each object.
The orphans are charged against the volume&#39;s quota and appear in the output of the <b>ls</b> command issued against the volume&#39;s root directory.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dt><a name="-client"
><b>-client</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Salvageserver runs in client Mode.
The requested volume on the requested partition will be scheduled for salvaging by the Salvageserver daemon.</p>

<dt><a name="-help"
><b>-help</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Prints the online help for this command.
All other valid options are ignored.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

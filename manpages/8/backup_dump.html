<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The <b>backup dump</b> command either dumps the volume set specified by the <b>-volumeset</b> argument at the dump level specified by the <b>-dump</b> argument and creates a Backup Database dump record about it,
or executes the dump instructions listed in the file named by the <b>-file</b> argument.
The Tape Coordinator indicated by the <b>-portoffset</b> argument (or on each command in the file) executes the operation.</p>

<p>(If the <code>FILE YES</code> instruction appears in the <em>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_<i>device_name</i></em> file on the Tape Coordinator machine associated with the specified port offset,
then the Backup System dumps data to the backup data file listed for that port offset in the Tape Coordinator&#39;s <em>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</em> file,
rather than to tape.
For the sake of clarity,
the following text refers to tapes only,
but the Backup System handles backup data files in much the same way.)</p>

<p>The term <i>dumping</i> refers to copying a collection of data to tape or a backup data file,
and the resulting collection is termed a <i>dump</i>.
The set of tapes that contain one or more dumps is called a <i>dump set</i>.
The first dump in a dump set is its <i>initial dump</i>,
and any dumps subsequently added to the dump set (by use of the <b>-append</b> argument) are <i>appended dumps</i>.
Creating appended dumps is optional,
and appended dumps can be of different volume sets,
and at different dump levels,
than the initial dump.</p>

<p>A <i>full dump</i>,
created at a full dump level in the dump hierarchy,
contains all of the data that existed at the time of the dump in the volumes belonging to the volume set.
An <i>incremental dump</i>,
created at an incremental dump level,
contains only data that has changed since the volume set was dumped at the incremental level&#39;s <i>parent dump level</i> (the dump level immediately above the incremental level in the hierarchy),
which can be a full or incremental level.
More specifically,
an incremental dump includes only the files and directories that have modification timestamps later than the <i>clone date</i> of the volume included at the parent dump level.
For backup and read-only volumes,
the clone date is the time at which the volume was cloned from its read/write source before being included in the parent dump; for read/write volumes,
it represents the time at which the volume was locked for inclusion in the parent dump.
The clone date appears in the <i>clone date</i> field of the output from the <b>backup volinfo</b> command.
As an example,
an incremental dump at the <code>/full/week1/thursday</code> level includes only files and directories that have changed since the volume set was dumped at the <code>/full/week1</code> level.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Initiating_different_types_of_dump_operations"
>Initiating different types of dump operations</a></h2>

<p>To initiate a dump operation that is to start as soon as the relevant Tape Coordinator is available,
provide only the <b>-volumeset</b>,
<b>-dump</b>,
<b>-portoffset</b>,
and optionally <b>-append</b> options.
To schedule a single <b>backup dump</b> command to execute in the future,
also include the <b>-at</b> argument to specify the start time.</p>

<p>To append a dump to an existing dump set,
include the <b>-append</b> flag.
The Backup System imposes the following conditions on appended dumps:</p>

<ul><li><p>If writing to tape,
the Tape Coordinator checks that it is the final one in a dump set for which there are complete and valid tape and dump records in the Backup Database.
If not,
it rejects the tape and requests an acceptable one.
The operator can use the <b>-dbadd</b> argument to the <b>backup scantape</b> command to insert the necessary records into the database.</p></li><li><p>The most recent dump on the tape or in the backup data file must have completed successfully.</p></li><li><p>The dump set must begin with an initial dump that is recorded in the Backup Database.
If there are no dumps on the tape,
then the Backup System treats the dump operation as an initial dump and imposes the relevant requirements (for example,
checks the AFS tape name if appropriate).</p></li></ul>

<p>To schedule multiple dump operations,
list the operations in the file named by the <b>-file</b> argument.
Optionally include the <b>-at</b> argument to specify when the <b>backup</b> command interpreter reads the file; otherwise it reads it immediately.
Do not combine the <b>-file</b> argument with the command&#39;s first three arguments or the <b>-append</b> or <b>-n</b> flags.
The commands in the file can include any of the <b>backup dump</b> command&#39;s arguments,
including the <b>-at</b> argument to schedule them to run even later in the future.</p>

<p>To generate a list of the volumes included in a dump,
without actually dumping them,
combine the <b>-n</b> flag with the options to be used on the actual command.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="How_the_Backup_System_executes_a_dump_operation"
>How the Backup System executes a dump operation</a></h2>

<p>Before beginning a dump operation,
the Backup System verifies that there is a Backup Database entry for the volume set,
dump level,
and port offset.
If the command is correctly formed and issued in interactive mode,
it is assigned a job number and added to the jobs list.
List jobs in interactive mode by using the <b>backup jobs</b> command; terminate them with the <b>backup kill</b> command.</p>

<p>After obtaining the list of volumes to dump from the Volume Location (VL) Server,
the Backup System sorts the list by site (server and partition).
It groups volumes from the same site together in the dump to minimize the number of times the operator must change tapes during restore operations.</p>

<p>The dependence of an incremental dump on its parent means that a valid parent dump must already exist for the Backup System to create its child incremental dump.
If the Backup System does not find a record of a dump created at the immediate parent dump level,
it looks in the Backup Database for a dump created at one level higher in the hierarchy,
and so on,
up to the full dump level if necessary.
It creates an incremental dump at the level one below the lowest valid parent dump set that it finds.
If it fails to find even a full dump,
it dumps the volume set at the full dump level.</p>

<p>If the Backup System is unable to access a volume during a dump operation,
it skips the volume and dumps the remaining volumes from the volume set.
Possible reasons a volume is inaccessible include server machine or process outages,
or that the volume was moved between the time the Volume Location (VL) Server generated the list of sites for the volume in the volume set and the time the Backup System actually attempts to dump the data in it.
After the first dumping pass,
the Backup System attempts to dump each volume it skipped.
If it still cannot dump a volume and the <code>ASK NO</code> instruction does not appear in the <em>CFG_<i>device_name</i></em> file,
it queries the operator as to whether it needs to attempt to dump the volume again,
omit the volume from the dump,
or halt the dump operation altogether.
When prompted,
the operator can attempt to solve whatever problem prevented the Backup System from accessing the volumes.
If the <code>ASK NO</code> instruction appears in the <em>CFG_<i>device_name</i></em> file,
the Backup System omits the volume from the dump.</p>

<p>Before scheduling a dump operation,
the Backup System verifies that the date specified by the <b>-at</b> argument is in the future,
and checks the validity of the volume set,
dump level and port offset as for a regular dump operation.
It checks the validity of the parameters again just before actually running the scheduled operation.</p>

<p>Before writing an initial dump to a tape that does not have a permanent name on the label,
the Backup System checks that the AFS tape name on the label is acceptable.
If desired,
disable name checking by including the <code>NAME_CHECK NO</code> instruction in the <em>CFG_<i>device_name</i></em> file.</p>

<p>If AFS tape name checking is enabled,
the Backup System accepts the following three types of values for the AFS tape name.
If the name on the label does not conform,
the Backup System obtains a tape with an acceptable label by invoking the <code>MOUNT</code> instruction in the <em>CFG_<i>device_name</i></em> file or prompting the operator.</p>

<ul><li><p>A name of the form <i>volume_set_name.dump_level_name.tape_index</i>,
where <i>volume_set_name</i> matches the value of the <b>-volumeset</b> argument,
<i>dump_level_name</i> matches the last element in the pathname value of the <b>-dump</b> argument,
and <i>tape_index</i> reflects the tape&#39;s place in a multitape dump set.
As an example,
the first tape in a dump set for which the initial dump is of volume set <code>user</code> at the dump level <code>/sunday2/monday</code> has AFS tape name <code>user.monday.1</code>.
If the label records this type of AFS tape name,
the Backup System retains the AFS tape name and writes the dump to the tape.</p></li><li><p>The string <code>&#60;NULL&#62;</code>,
which usually indicates that a backup operator has used the <b>backup labeltape</b> command to write a label on the tape,
but did not include the <b>-name</b> argument to assign an AFS tape name.
Presumably,
the operator did include the <b>-pname</b> argument to assign a permanent name.
If the label records a <code>&#60;NULL&#62;</code> value,
the Backup System constructs and records on the label the appropriate AFS tape name,
and writes the dump on the tape.</p></li><li><p>No value at all,
because the tape has never been labeled or used in the Backup System.
As when the AFS tape name is <code>&#60;NULL&#62;</code>,
the Backup System constructs and records on the label the appropriate AFS tape name,
and writes the dump on the tape.</p></li></ul>

<p>To determine how much data it can write to a tape,
the Tape Coordinator reads the capacity recorded on the tape&#39;s label (placed there by including the <b>-size</b> argument to the <b>backup labeltape</b> command).
If the label&#39;s capacity field is empty,
the Tape Coordinator uses the capacity recorded for the specified port offset in the local <em>tapeconfig</em> file.
If the capacity field in the <em>tapeconfig</em> file is also empty,
the Tape Coordinator uses the maximum capacity of 2 TB.</p>

<p>During a dump operation,
the Tape Coordinator tracks how much data it has written and stops shortly before it reaches what it believes is the tape&#39;s capacity.
If it is in the middle of writing the data for a volume when it reaches that point,
it writes a special marker that indicates an interrupted volume and continues writing the volume on the next tape.
It can split a volume this way during both an initial and an appended dump,
and the fact that the volume resides on multiple tapes is automatically recorded in the Backup Database.</p>

<p>If the tape is actually larger than the expected capacity,
then the Tape Coordinator simply does not use the excess tape.
If the tape is smaller than the expected capacity,
the Tape Coordinator can reach the end-of-tape (EOT) unexpectedly while it is writing data.
If the Tape Coordinator is in the middle of the writing data from a volume,
it obtains a new tape and rewrites the entire contents of the interrupted volume to it.
The data from the volume that was written to the previous tape remains there,
but is never used.</p>

<p>The Backup System allows recycling of tapes (writing a new dump set over an old dump set that is no longer needed),
but imposes the following conditions:</p>

<ul><li><p>All dumps in the old dump set must be expired.
The Backup System always checks expiration dates,
even when name checking is disabled.</p></li><li><p>If the tape to be recycled does not have a permanent name and name checking is enabled,
then the AFS tape name derived from the new initial dump&#39;s volume set name and dump level name must match the AFS tape name already recorded on the label.</p></li><li><p>The tape cannot already have data on it that belongs to the dump currently being performed,
because that implies that the operator or automated tape device has not removed the previous tape from the drive,
or has mistakenly reinserted it.
The Tape Coordinator generates the following message and attempts to obtain another tape:
<pre>   Can&#39;t overwrite tape containing the dump in progress</pre>
</p></li><li><p>The tape cannot contain data from a parent dump of the current (incremental) dump, because overwriting a parent dump makes it impossible to restore data from the current dump. The Tape Coordinator generates the following message and attempts to obtain another tape:
<pre>   Can&#39;t overwrite the parent dump I&#60;parent_name&#62; (I&#60;parent_dump_ID&#62;)</pre>
</p></li></ul>

<p>To recycle a tape before all dumps on it have expired or if the AFS tape name is wrong, use the <b>backup labeltape</b> command to overwrite the tape&#39;s label and remove all associated tape and dump records from the Backup Database.</p>

<p>The Tape Coordinator&#39;s default response to this command is to access the first tape by invoking the <code>MOUNT</code> instruction in the <em>CFG_<i>device_name</i></em> file, or by prompting the backup operator to insert the tape if there is no <code>MOUNT</code> instruction. However, if the <code>AUTOQUERY NO</code> instruction appears in the <em>CFG_<i>device_name</i></em> file, or if the issuer of the <b>butc</b> command included the <b>-noautoquery</b> flag, the Tape Coordinator instead expects the tape to be in the device already. If it is not, the Tape Coordinator invokes the <code>MOUNT</code> instruction or prompts the operator. It also invokes the <code>MOUNT</code> instruction or prompts for any additional tapes needed to complete the dump operation; the issuer must arrange to provide them.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="CAUTIONS"
>CAUTIONS</a></h1>

<p>If a dump operation is interrupted or fails for any reason, data from all volumes written to tape before the interrupt are valid can be used in a restore operation. The Backup Database includes an entry for the failed dump and for each volume that was successfully dumped. See the <i>IBM AFS Administration Guide</i> for information on dealing with interrupted dumps.</p>

<p>If dumping to tape rather than a backup data file, it is best to use only compatible tape devices (ones that can read the same type of tape). Using compatible devices greatly simplifies restore operations. The <b>-portoffset</b> argument to the <b>backup diskrestore</b> and <b>backup volsetrestore</b> commands accepts multiple port offset numbers, but the Backup System uses the first listed port offset when restoring all full dumps, the second port offset when restoring all level 1 dumps, and so on. At the very least, use compatible tape devices to perform dumps at each level. If compatible tape devices are not used, the <b>backup volrestore</b> command must be used to restore one volume at a time.</p>

<p>Valid (unexpired) administrative tokens must be available to the <b>backup</b> command interpreter both when it reads the file named by the <b>-file</b> argument and when it runs each operation listed in the file. Presumably, the issuer is scheduling dumps for times when no human operator is present, and so must arrange for valid tokens to be available on the local machine. One option is to issue all commands (or run all scripts) on file server machines and use the <b>-localauth</b> flag on the <b>backup</b> and <b>vos</b> commands. To protect against improper access to the machine or the tokens, the machine must be physically secure (perhaps even more protected than a Tape Coordinator machine monitored by a human operator during operation). Also, if an unattended dump requires multiple tapes, the operator must properly configure a tape stacker or jukebox and the device configuration file.</p>

<p>When the command is issued in regular (non-interactive) mode, the command shell prompt does not return until the dump operation completes. To avoid having to open additional connections, issue the command in interactive mode, especially when including the <b>-at</b> argument to schedule dump operations.</p>

Provide a value in the format <i>mm/dd/yyyy</i> [<i>hh:MM</i>], where the month (<i>mm</i>), day (<i>dd</i>), and year (<i>yyyy</i>) are required. Valid values for the year range from <code>1970</code> to <code>2037</code>; higher values are not valid because the latest possible date in the standard UNIX representation is in February 2038. The Backup System automatically reduces any later date to the maximum value.</p>

<p>The hour and minutes (<i>hh:MM</i>) are optional, but if provided must be in 24-hour format (for example, the value <code>14:36</code> represents 2:36 p.m.). If omitted, the time defaults to midnight (00:00 hours).</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The <b>backup adddump</b> command creates one or more dump levels in the dump hierarchy stored in the Backup Database,
and optionally assigns an expiration date to each one.
All of the dump levels in the Backup Database collectively constitute the dump hierarchy.</p>

<p>Use the <b>-expires</b> argument to associate an expiration date with each dump level.
When the Backup System subsequently creates a dump at the dump level,
it uses the specified value to derive the dump&#39;s expiration date,
which it records on the label of the tape (or backup data file).
The Backup System refuses to overwrite a tape until after the latest expiration date of any dump that the tape contains,
unless the <b>backup labeltape</b> command is used to relabel the tape.
If a dump level does not have an expiration date,
the Backup System treats dumps created at the level as expired as soon as it creates them.</p>

<p>(Note that the Backup System does not automatically remove a dump&#39;s record from the Backup Database when the dump reaches its expiration date,
but only if the tape that contains the dump is recycled or relabeled.
To remove expired and other obsolete dump records,
use the <b>backup deletedump</b> command.)</p>

<p>Define either an absolute or relative expiration date:</p>

<ul><li><p>An absolute expiration date defines the month/day/year (and,
optionally,
hour and minutes) at which a dump expires.
If the expiration date predates the dump creation time,
the Backup System immediately treats the dump as expired.</p></li><li><p>A relative date defines the number of years,
months,
or days (or a combination of the three) after the dump&#39;s creation that it expires.
When the Backup System creates a dump at the dump level,
it calculates an actual expiration date by adding the relative date to the start time of the dump operation.</p></li></ul>

>OPTIONS</a></h1>

<dl>
<dt><a name="-dump_&#60;dump_level_name&#62;+"
><b>-dump</b> &#60;<i>dump level name</i>&#62;+</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Names each dump level to add to the dump hierarchy.
Precede full dump level names with a slash (for example,
<code>/full</code>).
Indicate an incremental dump level by preceding it with an ordered list of the dump levels directly above it in the hierarchy (its parent dump levels); use the slash as a separator.
The parent dump levels must already exist.
For example,
the dump levels <code>/full</code> and <code>/full/incremental1</code> must exist when the incremental dump level <code>/full/incremental1/incremental2</code> is created.</p>

<p>Dump level names can have any number of levels,
but cannot exceed 256 characters in length,
including the slashes.
The maximum length for any single level (the text between slashes) is 28 characters,
not including the preceding slash.</p>

<p>All alphanumeric characters are allowed in dump level names.
Do not use the period (<code>.</code>),
however,
because it is the separator between the volume set name and dump level name in the dump name assigned automatically by the <b>backup dump</b> command.
It is best not to include other metacharacters either; if using them,
enclose them in double quotes (<code>&#34; &#34;</code>) when issuing the <b>backup adddump</b> command outside interactive mode.</p>

<dt><a name="-expires_&#60;expiration_date&#62;+"
><b>-expires</b> &#60;<i>expiration date</i>&#62;+</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Defines the absolute or relative expiration date to associate with each dump level named by the <b>-dump</b> argument.
Absolute expiration dates have the following format:</p>

<pre>   [at] {NEVER | &#60;mm&#62;/&#60;dd&#62;/&#60;yyyy&#62; [&#60;hh&#62;:&#60;MM&#62;] }</pre>

<p>where the optional word at is followed either by the string <code>NEVER</code>, which indicates that dumps created at the dump level never expire, or by a date value with a required portion (&#60;mm&#62; for month, &#60;dd&#62; for day, and &#60;yyyy&#62; for year) and an optional portion (&#60;hh&#62; for hours and &#60;MM&#62; for minutes).</p>

<p>Omit the <i>hh:MM</i> portion to use the default of midnight (00:00 hours), or provide a value in 24-hour format (for example, <code>20:30</code> is 8:30 p.m.). Valid values for the year range from <code>1970</code> to <code>2037</code>; higher values are not valid because the latest possible date in the standard UNIX representation is in February 2038. The command interpreter automatically reduces later dates to the maximum value.</p>

<p>Relative expiration dates have the following format:</p>

<pre>   [in] [&#60;years&#62;y] [&#60;months&#62;m] [&#60;days&#62;d]</pre>

<p>where the optional word in is followed by at least one of a number of years (maximum <code>9999</code>) followed by the letter <code>y</code>, a number of months (maximum <code>12</code>) followed by the letter <code>m</code>, or a number of days (maximum <code>31</code>) followed by the letter <code>d</code>. If providing more than one of the three, list them in the indicated order. If the date that results from adding the relative expiration value to a dump&#39;s creation time is later than the latest possible date in the UNIX time representation, the Backup System automatically reduces it to that date.</p>

<dt><a name="-localauth"
><b>-localauth</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local <em>/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</em> file. The <b>backup</b> command interpreter presents it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the <b>-cell</b> argument. For more details, see <a href="../8/backup.html" class="podlinkman"
>backup(8)</a>.</p>

<dt><a name="-cell_&#60;cell_name&#62;"
><b>-cell</b> &#60;<i>cell name</i>&#62;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument with the <b>-localauth</b> flag. For more details, see <a href="../8/backup.html" class="podlinkman"
>backup(8)</a>.</p>

<dt><a name="-help"
><b>-help</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.</p>
</dd>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="EXAMPLES"
>EXAMPLES</a></h1>

<p>The following command defines a full dump called <code>/1999</code> with a relative expiration date of one year:</p>

<pre>   % backup adddump -dump /1999 -expires in 1y</pre>

<p>The following command defines an incremental dump called <code>/sunday1/monday</code>1 with a relative expiration date of 13 days:</p>

<pre>   % backup adddump -dump /sunday1/monday1 -expires in 13d</pre>

<p>The following command defines two dump incremental dump levels, <code>/Monthly/Week1</code> and <code>/Monthly/Week2</code>. Their parent, the full dump level <code>/Monthly</code>, must already exist. The expiration date for both levels is 12:00 a.m. on 1 January 2000.</p>

<pre>   % backup adddump -dump /Monthly/Week1 /Monthly/Week2 -expires at 01/01/2000</pre>

<p>The issuer must be listed in the <em>/usr/afs/etc/UserList</em> file on every machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a server machine as the local superuser <code>root</code> if the <b>-localauth</b> flag is included.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="DESCRIPTION"
>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>The <b>aklog</b> program authenticates to a cell in AFS by obtaining AFS tokens using a Kerberos 5 ticket.
If <b>aklog</b> is invoked with no command-line arguments,
it will obtain tokens for the workstation&#39;s local cell.
It may be invoked with an arbitrary number of cells and pathnames to obtain tokens for multiple cells.
<b>aklog</b> knows how to expand cell name abbreviations,
so cells can be referred to by enough letters to make the cell name unique among the cells the workstation knows about.</p>

<p><b>aklog</b> obtains tokens by obtaining a Kerberos service ticket for the AFS service and then storing it as a token.
By default,
it obtains that ticket from the realm corresponding to that cell (the uppercase version of the cell name),
but a different realm for a particular cell can be specified with <b>-k</b>.
<b>-k</b> cannot be used in <b>-path</b> mode (see below).</p>

<p>When a Kerberos 5 cross-realm trust is used,
<b>aklog</b> looks up the AFS ID corresponding to the name (Kerberos principal) of the person invoking the command,
and if the user doesn&#39;t exist and the system:authuser@FOREIGN.REALM PTS group exists,
then it attempts automatic registration of the user with the foreign cell.
The user is then added to the system:authuser@FOREIGN.REALM PTS group if registration is successful.
Automatic registration in the foreign cell will fail if the group quota for the system:authuser@FOREIGN.REALM group is less than one.
Each automatic registration decrements the group quota by one.</p>

<p>When using <b>aklog</b>,
be aware that AFS uses the Kerberos v4 principal naming format,
not the Kerberos v5 format,
when referring to principals in PTS ACLs,
<em>UserList</em>,
and similar locations.
AFS will internally map Kerberos v5 principal names to the Kerberos v4 syntax by removing any portion of the instance after the first period (generally the domain name of a host principal),
changing any <code>/</code> to <code>.</code>,
and changing an initial principal part of <code>host</code> to <code>rcmd</code>.
In other words,
to create a PTS entry for the Kerberos v5 principal <code>user/admin</code>,
refer to it as <code>user.admin</code>,
and for the principal <code>host/shell.example.com</code>,
refer to it as <code>rcmd.shell</code>.</p>

>OPTIONS</a></h1>

<dl>
<dt><a name="-524"
><b>-524</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Normally,
<b>aklog</b> generates native K5 tokens.
This flag tells <b>aklog</b> to instead use the krb524 translation service to generate K4 or rxkad2b tokens,
which may be necessary for AFS cells that don&#39;t support native K5 tokens.
Support for native K5 tokens were added in OpenAFS 1.2.8.</p>

<dt><a name="-cell_&#60;cell&#62;,_-c_&#60;cell&#62;"
><b>-cell</b> &#60;<i>cell</i>&#62;,
<b>-c</b> &#60;<i>cell</i>&#62;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This flag tells <b>aklog</b> that the next argument is the name of a cell to authenticate to.
It normally isn&#39;t necessary; <b>aklog</b> normally determines whether an argument is a cell or a path name based on whether it contains <code>/</code> or is <code>.</code> or <code>..</code>.
The cell may be followed by <b>-k</b> to specify the corresponding Kerberos realm.</p>

<dt><a name="-d"
><b>-d</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Turns on printing of debugging information.
This option is not intended for general users.</p>

<dt><a name="-force"
><b>-force</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Normally,
aklog will not replace tokens with new tokens that appear to be identical.
If this flag is given,
it will skip that check.</p>

<dt><a name="-hosts"
><b>-hosts</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Prints all the server addresses which may act as a single point of failure in accessing the specified directory path.
Each element of the path is examined,
and as new volumes are traversed,
if they are not replicated,
the server&#39;s IP address containing the volume will be displayed.
The output is of the form:</p>

<pre>    host: &#60;ip-address&#62;</pre>

<p>This option is only useful in combination with paths as arguments rather than cells.</p>

<dt><a name="-k_&#60;Kerberos_realm&#62;"
><b>-k</b> &#60;<i>Kerberos realm</i>&#62;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This flag is valid only immediately after the name of the cell. It tells <b>aklog</b> to use that Kerberos realm when authenticating to the preceding cell. By default, <b>aklog</b> will use the realm (per the local Kerberos configuration) of the first database server in the cell, so this flag normally won&#39;t be necessary.</p>

<dt><a name="-linked"
><b>-linked</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>If the AFS cell is linked to a DCE cell, get tokens for both.</p>

<dt><a name="-noauth"
><b>-noauth</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Don&#39;t actually authenticate, just do everything else <b>aklog</b> does up to setting tokens.</p>

<dt><a name="-noprdb"
><b>-noprdb</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Ordinarily, <b>aklog</b> looks up the AFS ID corresponding to the name of the person invoking the command, and if the user doesn&#39;t exist, the cell is a foreign one, the system:authuser@FOREIGN.REALM PTS group exists, and has a positive group quota, then it attempts automatic registration of the user with the foreign cell. Specifying this flag turns off this functionality. This may be desirable if the protection database is unavailable for some reason and tokens are desired anyway, or if one wants to disable user registration.</p>

<dt><a name="-path_&#60;pathname&#62;,_-p_&#60;pathname&#62;"
><b>-path</b> &#60;<i>pathname</i>&#62;, <b>-p</b> &#60;<i>pathname</i>&#62;</a></dt>

<dd>
<p>This flag tells <b>aklog</b> that the next argument is a path in AFS. <b>aklog</b> will walk that path and obtain tokens for every cell needed to access all of the directories. Normally, this flag isn&#39;t necessary; <b>aklog</b> assumes an argument is a path if it contains <code>/</code> or is <code>.</code> or <code>..</code>.</p>

<dt><a name="-setpag"
><b>-setpag</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>When setting tokens, attempt to put the parent process in a new PAG. This is usually used as part of the login process but can be used any time to create a new AFS authentication context. Note that this in some cases relies on dangerous and tricky manipulations of kernel records and will not work on all platforms or with all Linux kernels.</p>

<dt><a name="-zsubs"
><b>-zsubs</b></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>Prints out the Zephyr subscription information to get alerts regarding all of the file servers required to access a particular path. The output is of the form:</p>

<pre>    zsub: &#60;instance&#62;</pre>

<p>where &#60;instance&#62; is the instance of a class <code>filsrv</code> Zephyr subscription.</p>
</dd>

><em>~/.xlog</em></a></dt>

<dd>
<p>If this file exists in the user&#39;s home directory, it should contain a list of AFS cells to which to authenticate, one per line. If <b>aklog</b> is invoked without any options, it will attempt to obtain tokens in every cell listed in this file if it exists, rather than only obtaining tokens for the local cell.</p>

<dt><a name="7"

<dd>
<p>Miscellaneous -- An internal failure occurred. For example, <b>aklog</b> returns this if it runs out of memory.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'

<p>To get tokens for the local cell:</p>

<pre>    % aklog</pre>

<p>To get tokens for the <code>athena.mit.edu</code> cell:</p>

<pre>    % aklog athena.mit.edu</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>    % aklog athena</pre>

<p>The latter will work if you local cache manager already knows about the <code>athena</code> cell.</p>

<p>To get tokens adequate to read <em>/afs/athena.mit.edu/user/p/potato</em>:</p>

<pre>    % aklog /afs/athena.mit.edu/user/p/potato</pre>

<p>To get tokens for <code>testcell.mit.edu</code> that is in a test Kerberos realm:</p>

<pre>    % aklog testcell.mit.edu -k TESTREALM.MIT.EDU</pre>

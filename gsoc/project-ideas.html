<h1>Google Summer of Code Project Ideas</h1>

<p>For information about OpenAFS's participation in the Google Summer of Code
project, please see <a href="/gsoc.html">this</a> page.</p>

<p>The following list represents some of our ideas and wishes for the project.
However, suggesting your own idea is always encouraged. Please review the <a
href="https://gerrit.openafs.org">OpenAFS Gerrit</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/openafs-contrib">OpenAFS Contrib</a> for projects
already in progress.</p>


<h2><em>Idea:</em> OpenAFS for macOS Preference Pane</h2>

<p><em>Description:</em>
The OpenAFS for macOS client includes a GUI preference pane for configuring the
client, as a more user friendly alternative to command line tools. However,
much of the preference pane is not functional on current versions of macOS due
to security model changes by Apple.  In this project, the student will update
the OpenAFS preference pane to use modern security APIs to restore
functionality and generally update the user interface.</p>

<h2><em>Idea:</em> afsio: Mount point and ACL creation</h2>
<p><em>Description:</em>
The <code>afsio</code> is a command line client which can read or write files
out of the AFS filesystem without the requirement for a kernel module. It is
currently limited to anonymous reading and writing files. In this project, the
functionally would be expanded to authenticated access (via a security key),
and the ability to create mount points within an AFS volume, and the ability to
read and set access control lists on directories with AFS.  This would allow
site administrators and developers to create new AFS cells with only userspace
command line tools on the servers.</p>

<h2><em>Idea:</em> Per volume reverse name lookup index</h2>

<p><em>Description:</em> Directory entries are stored within AFS3 directory
objects in directory vnodes. The directory objects provide a fast lookup of
directory entry names to vnode id numbers. Code exists to do reverse id to name
lookup, however reverse lookups are computationally expensive, so does not
perform well.</p>

<p>In this project, a new per volume index will be introduced which provides a
id to path name(s) lookup for a given file id within the volume. The index can
be created when the volume is created or restored, and updated on directory
updates.  This new index could be used by the <code>volscan</code> utility to
vastly improve performance of the volume meta data scanning, and in the future
be used to provide fast file find services.</p>

<h2><em>Idea:</em> Fileserver memory footprint autotuning</h2>

<p><em>Description:</em>OpenAFS fileserver installations require a set of
command line options to specify the amount of memory to be used by the
fileserver process. These options need to be tuned to the target host.  Presets
are available for classes of machine sizes, but all of them are unusable small
for modern environments.  Instead of continuing to add new presets, in the
project a new autotuning mode will be implemented to allow the fileserver to
automatically adjust it's memory footprint to the available machine memory.  A
starting point for implementation is available in the OpenAFS gerrit code
review system.</p>

<h2><em>Idea:</em> Program language bindings for OpenAFS tool suite</h2>

<p><em>Description:</em>OpenAFS provides a set of command-line tools to manage
services, volumes, users, groups, and access controls (i.e., <code>vos</code>,
<code>pts</code>, <code>fs</code>). A set of C language libraries are also
available for sites to implement tooling, but these libraries are typically
lower level and do not include all the functionality included in the
command-line tools.</p>
<p>In this project, a C language interface and a set of SWIG binding would
be introduced to allow the same code executed by the command-line tools
to be executed programmatically. A good implementation would minimize code
churn.</p>

<h2><em>Idea:</em> OpenAFS Load Testing</h2>

<p><em>Description:</em>
Develop an OpenAFS plugin for the JMeter open-source stress testing tool to
support stress testing file servers and volume location servers. The plugin
will be implemented in Java. A Java-to-C interface (JNI) will be required to
implement client plugin.</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop a plugin with JNI to mimic a large number of AFS3 clients by
  the JMeter stress test tool.</li>
<li>Support testing of volume location servers (volume lookup queries)</li>
<li>Support testing of file servers (file read/write accesses)</li>
<li>Develop and document JMeter setup with OpenAFS to perform
  various stress testing scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<h2><em>Idea:</em> OpenAFS Integration Testing Improvements</h2>

<p><em>Description:</em>
In this project, the student would improve the set of basic OpenAFS integration
tests, implemented with the Robot Framework open source test automation
framework.  The test cases are implemented in the Robot Framework keyword
language. A set of OpenAFS specific keywords are implemented in Python.
Ansible Molecule templates are provided to create working test environments
quickly using Vagrant or cloud-hosted virtual machines.</p>

<p>Additional tests and keywords would be implemented under the guidance of the
mentor.</p>

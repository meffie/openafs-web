Topic: Denial of service attack against OpenAFS fileserver processes
      CVE-2014-0159

Issued:		14-April-2014
Last Update:    14-April-2014
Affected:	OpenAFS file servers
			running versions 1.4.8 thru 1.6.6

An attacker with the ability to connect to an OpenAFS fileserver can
trigger a buffer overflow, crashing the server.

Clients are not affected.

SUMMARY
=======

The GetStatistics64 remote procedure call (RPC) was introduced in
OpenAFS 1.4.8 as part of the support for fileserver partitions larger
than 2 TiB. The GetStatistics64 RPC is used by remote administrative
programs to retrieve statistical information about fileservers. The
GetStatistics64 RPC requests do not require authentication.

A bug has been discovered in the GetStatistics64 RPC which can trigger a
fileserver crash.  The version argument of the GetStatistics64 RPC is
used to determine how much memory is allocated for the RPC reply.
However the range of this argument is not validated, allowing an
attacker to cause insufficient memory to be allocated for the
statistical information reply buffer.


IMPACT
======

By sending an unauthenticated request for fileserver statistical
information, it is possible to crash a file server running the
affected code.

No publicly available exploits are currently known.


AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS 1.4.8 to (and including) 1.6.6

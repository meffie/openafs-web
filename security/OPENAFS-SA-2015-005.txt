Topic: Solaris grouplist modifications for PAGs can panic or overwrite memory
       CVE-2015-3286

Issued:         29-July-2015
Last Update:    29-July-2015
Affected:       OpenAFS versions through 1.6.12

A local user joining a PAG could overflow the buffer allocated
to store the group list and overwrite kernel memory.

SUMMARY
=======

A fixed size buffer was used to store the group list in the kernel,
but beginning with Solaris 10, the kernel would allow more groups than
would fit in this list.


IMPACT
======

As groups are encoded as 32 bit integers, groups at the end of the group list
could be pushed into arbitrary memory. Additionally, attempts to return an error could deadlock the kernel.


AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

The Solaris kernel extension in versions through 1.6.12 is vulnerable


FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators of fileservers upgrade
to OpenAFS version 1.6.13 or newer.

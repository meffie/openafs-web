                      OpenAFS Security Advisory 2009-002                       
                                CVE-2009-1250

Topic: Denial of service attack against Linux cache manager

Issued:		06-Apr-2009
Last Update:    06-Apr-2009
Affected:	Linux OpenAFS clients
		running versions 1.0 thru 1.4.8 & 1.5.0 thru 1.5.58

An attacker with control of a fileserver, or the ability to forge RX packets,
can crash the cache manager, and hence the kernel, of affected Linux AFS
clients.

SUMMARY
=======

AFS may pass an error code obtained from the fileserver directly to the
Linux kernel, using a Linux mechanism that merges error codes and pointers 
into a single value. However, this mechanism is unable to distinguish certain
error codes from pointers. When AFS returns a code of this type to the kernel,
the kernel treats it as a pointer and attempts to dereference it. This causes a
kernel panic, and results in a denial of service attack.

IMPACT
======

By forging responses from an existing fileserver, or by getting a user to
visit a fileserver under their control, an attacker may crash the client
under attack.

No publicly available exploits are currently known.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS up to (and including) 1.4.8
All releases of OpenAFS 1.5.0 to 1.5.58

Only the Linux cache manager is affected.

FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators with Linux clients 
upgrade to OpenAFS version 1.4.9 or newer, or as appropriate for people 
testing features in the OpenAFS 1.5 series, OpenAFS version 1.5.59 or newer. 
Only Linux clients need to be upgraded.

For those sites unable, or unwilling, to upgrade a patch which resolves this
issue is available as
    STABLE14-linux-avoid-returning-invalid-pointers-on-error-20090402 
in the OpenAFS delta system, or directly from 
    http://www.openafs.org/security/openafs-sa-2009-002.patch
The corresponding PGP signature is available from
    http://www.openafs.org/security/openafs-sa-2009-002.sig

Note that this patch is against 1.4.8, although it may apply to earlier 
releases. Patches for 1.5 and HEAD are available from wdelta, or in CVS.

The latest stable OpenAFS release is always available from 
http://www.openafs.org/release/latest.html

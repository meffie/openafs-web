Topic: Buffer overflow in OpenAFS vlserver
       CVE-2015-6587

Issued:         29-July-2015
Last Update:    29-July-2015
Affected:       OpenAFS versions through 1.6.12

A network user running a VL_ListAttributesN2 RPC could attack
regular expression handling code in the vlserver.

SUMMARY
=======

The vlserver allows pattern matching on volume names via regular expressions
when listing attributes. Because the regular expression is not checked for
situations which can overflow the buffers used, an attack is possible which
reads arbitrary memory beyond the end of the buffer and can act on it
as part of the expression evaluation, potentially crashing the process.


IMPACT
======

A caller could cause a denial of service by causing a vlserver to evaluate
memory beyond was provided in the regular expression or exploit issues
in the local regular expression handling implementation.


AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

The vlserver executable in versions through 1.6.12 is affected.


FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators of fileservers upgrade
to OpenAFS version 1.6.13 or newer.

<h1>OpenAFS Security Advisories</h1>
<p>The following are overviews of security advisories issued by the
OpenAFS Project regarding known security problems in OpenAFS and its
components.  Each overview includes a summary of the problem, a link
to the full text of the advisory.  When they are available, patches
are also included.

At the end of this document is a <a href="#salist">table of all
OpenAFS security advisories</a>.

<p>There is an integer overflow bug in the SUNRPC-derived RPC library
used by OpenAFS that could be exploited to crash certain OpenAFS
servers (volserver, vlserver, ptserver, buserver) or to obtain
unauthorized root access to a host running one of these processes.

<p>In addition, it is possible for a rogue server to attack certain
administrative clients (vos, pts, backup, butc, rxstat), but only
if certain RPC requests are made to the rogue server.

<p>The OpenAFS fileserver and cache manager (client) are not vulnerable
to these attacks.  No exploits are presently known to be available
for this vulnerability.

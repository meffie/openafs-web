Topic: kernel pioctl support for OSD command passing can trigger a panic
       CVE-2015-3285

Issued:         29-July-2015
Last Update:    29-July-2015
Affected:       OpenAFS versions 1.0.3 through 1.6.12

A local user executing the OSD FS command pioctl can trigger a panic
due to an incorrect buffer being used for return status of the command.

SUMMARY
=======

The kernel handling of the FS command for OSD (and previously, the
residency command for MR-AFS) used a pointer to the wrong in-kernel memory
when returning the result of the RPC, and could cause a panic by
overwriting unrelated memory.


IMPACT
======

A local user of the client can cause a panic or other kernel memory
corruption, although not with arbitrary contents.


AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

The kernel extension in versions 1.0.3 through 1.6.12 is affected.


FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators of fileservers upgrade
to OpenAFS version 1.6.13 or newer.

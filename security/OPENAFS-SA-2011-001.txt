Topic: Denial of service attack against Rx server processes
       CVE-2011-0430

Issued:		23-Feb-2011
Last Update:    23-Feb-2011
Affected:	OpenAFS servers
		running versions 1.2.8 thru 1.4.12.1 & 1.5.0 thru 1.5.74

An attacker with the ability to connect to an Rx server can trigger a double
free, crashing the server. Clients are not affected.

SUMMARY
=======

AFS uses Heimdal Kerberos 5 libraries to support authentication tokens
including a limited subset of a Kerberos 5 ticket. Due to a bug in Heimdal
which could cause a double-free to occur in some circumstances, it is possible
to crash an Rx server which verifies tokens meeting certain criteria thus
triggering this bug, leading to a denial of service. Kerberos 5 is not
required to be configured for this defect to be exploitable.

As AFS clients do not provide an encrypted callback channel, no client
software is affected; Issues are present only in AFS servers.

IMPACT
======

By sending authenticated Rx traffic using a constructed bad ticket,
it is possible to crash an Rx server running the affected code.

No publicly available exploits are currently known.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS 1.2.8 to (and including) 1.4.12.1
All releases of OpenAFS 1.5.0 to 1.5.74

Contrary to the erroneous CVE, 1.4.14 is NOT affected.

FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade to OpenAFS version
1.4.14 or newer, or as appropriate for people testing features in the OpenAFS
1.5 series, OpenAFS version 1.5.75 or newer. 

For those sites unable, or unwilling, to upgrade a patch which resolves this
issue is available directly from

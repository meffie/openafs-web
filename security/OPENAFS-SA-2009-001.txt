                      OpenAFS Security Advisory 2009-001
                                CVE-2009-1251 

Topic: Network based buffer overflow attack against Unix cache manager

Issued:		06-Apr-2009
Last Update:    06-Apr-2009
Affected:	OpenAFS Unix clients (excluding Mac OS X 10.4 & 10.5)
		running versions 1.0 -> 1.4.8 and 1.5.0 -> 1.5.58

An attacker with control of a fileserver, or the ability to forge RX packets, 
can crash the cache manager, and hence the kernel, of any Unix AFS client. It
may be possible for an attacker to cause the kernel to execute arbitrary code.

SUMMARY
=======

AFS's XDR data marshalling language permits the construction of arrays with a
size constrained by the interface definition. The XDR decoding language will
accept data from the server up to this maximum size, which in some cases is
stored into a buffer allocated by the client. 

In several locations, the AFS client assumes that the server will never
return more data than requested, and so allocates a buffer smaller than this
maximum size. Whilst this causes no problems when communicating with valid
servers, an attacker can return more data than expected, and overflow the
client's buffer.

IMPACT
======

By forging responses from an existing fileserver, or by getting a user to 
visit a fileserver under their control, an attacker may overflow
the heap buffer of a client machine. This buffer resides in kernel memory. 
A remote user can use this overflow to crash the client under attack, and 
may be able to execute arbitrary code within a client's kernel.

At the time of writing, no publicly available exploits are known.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS up to (and including) 1.4.8
All releases of OpenAFS 1.5.0 to 1.5.58

Only the Unix client, excluding Mac OS 10.3 and 10.4, is affected.

FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators with Unix clients 
upgrade to OpenAFS version 1.4.9 or newer, or as appropriate for people 
testing features in the OpenAFS 1.5 series, OpenAFS version 1.5.59 or newer. 
Only Unix clients need to be upgraded to address the issue in this advisory.

For those sites unable, or unwilling, to upgrade a patch which resolves this
issue is available as
    STABLE14-avoid-buffer-overflow-on-rx-fixed-size-array-return-20090402
in the OpenAFS delta system, or directly from
    http://www.openafs.org/security/openafs-sa-2009-001.patch
The corresponding PGP signature is available from
    http://www.openafs.org/security/openafs-sa-2009-001.sig

Note that this patch is against 1.4.8, although it may apply to earlier 
releases, and to other branches.

The latest stable OpenAFS release is always available from

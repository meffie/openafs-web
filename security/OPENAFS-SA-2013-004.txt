OpenAFS Security Advisory 2013-004

Topic: vos -encrypt doesn't encrypt connection data
       CVE-2013-4135

Issued:
Last Updated:
Affected: All OpenAFS clients

The -encrypt option to the 'vos' volume management command should cause
it to encrypt all data between client and server. However, in versions of
OpenAFS later than 1.6.0, it has no effect, and data is transmitted with
integrity protection only. In all versions of OpenAFS, vos -encrypt has
no effect when combined with the -localauth option.

IMPACT
======

Information which should be encrypted on the wire is only integrity
protected. An attacker may read RPC's initiated by the 'vos' command
which the administrator expected to remain private.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All current releases of OpenAFS.

FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade to OpenAFS 1.6.5
or later.

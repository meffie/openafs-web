Topic: pioctls leak kernel memory contents
       CVE-2015-3284

Issued:         29-July-2015
Last Update:    29-July-2015
Affected:       OpenAFS versions 1.6.0 through 1.6.12

A local user executing commands which make pioctl calls to the kernel
will have some contents of kernel memory leaked when buffers used are
larger than data being returned.

SUMMARY
=======

The kernel's pioctl handling uses either a private pool of buffers or allocated
memory depending on the size of what is anticipated to be returned. In either
case a buffer larger than needed can be used, leaking the contents of the
buffer to the caller.


IMPACT
======

Stack or private pool memory can be leaked to a local caller.


AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

OpenAFS kernel extensions for versions 1.6.0 through 1.6.12

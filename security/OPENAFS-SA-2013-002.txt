OpenAFS Security Advisory 2013-0002

Topic: Buffer overflow in OpenAFS ptserver
       CVE-2013-1795

Issued:		21 Feb 2013
Last Updated:	21 Feb 2013
Affected:	OpenAFS servers before version 1.6.2

An attacker can crash an OpenAFS ptserver by sending an IdToName RPC with
a large payload.

SUMMARY
=======

The ptserver accepts a list of unbounded size from the IdToName RPC. The
length of this list is then used to determine the size of a number of other
internal datastructures. If the length is sufficiently large then we may
hit an integer overflow when calculating the size to pass to malloc, and 
allocate data structures of insufficient length, allowing heap memory to
be overwritten.

IMPACT
======

An unauthenticated attacker can crash an OpenAFS ptserver

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS prior to 1.6.2

FIXES

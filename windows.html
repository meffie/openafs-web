OpenAFS is the world's foremost location independent file system.&nbsp;
With OpenAFS for Windows, users of Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, 2003, XP64, Vista
(32-bit and 64-bit editions) and Server 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit editions) can make the most of this proven data sharing
solution.&nbsp; The OpenAFS Project provides binary installation packages
appropriate for both individual users and organizations with thousands
of members.<br>

<h2><a name="whichversion">How to Decide Which Version to Install</a></h2>
<!--
<p>OpenAFS for Windows releases are labeled <b><i>Maintenance</i></b> or <b><i>
Features</i></b>.&nbsp; These labels are not related to the quality of the 
release but to the source code repository branch from which the release is 
generated.&nbsp; The <b><i>Maintenance</i></b> branch is a version of the source code 
which is undergoing a slower rate of change.&nbsp; Where the <b><i>Features</i></b> 
branch may be used to release one or more versions per month, the <b><i>
Maintenance</i></b> 
branch is likely to have one release every six or more months.&nbsp; The <b><i>
Maintenance</i></b> branch is not used to deliver new functionality nor it is used to 
support new platforms.&nbsp; Bugs will always be fixed in the <b><i>Features</i></b> 
branch but may not always be fixed in the <b><i>Maintenance</i></b> branch.&nbsp; 
Carefully review the feature list of the <b><i>Features</i></b> branch before 
deciding against its use.&nbsp; Many of the features such as file locking, large 
file support, and inline bulk status calls are crucial to obtaining good 
performance with AFS and Microsoft Office applications among others.</p>
-->

<p>The following guidelines should be used for choosing an installer type.  If you are upgrading
from a previous installation, select the same type of installer, EXE or MSI, as was 
previously installed on the system.  If you are installing for the first time, choose the
EXE if you are installing manually and the MSI if you either need to customize the 
installation package (via a transform) or wish to deploy via Active Directory Group Policy.
</p>
<p>
Each installer is provided in debug and non-debug versions.  The debug versions should
be installed only when you are experiencing a problem and you need to assist
the OpenAFS developers in debugging the problem.  The non-debug version is optimized for
performance, does not generate logging information by default, and does not install 
symbol files.<h3><a name="signatures">Digital Signatures</a></h3>
<p>
All of the installers are produced and signed by <a href="https://www.secure-endpoints.com" title="Secure Endpoints Inc.">
Secure Endpoints Inc.</a>.  If the signature is missing do not complete the installation 
process and send e-mail to 
<a href="mailto:openafs-security@openafs.org?subject=Missing or Incorrect Digital Signature">openafs-security@openafs.org</a>

<h2><a name="release">OpenAFS for Windows 1.5.59 (1.5.5900.0)</a></h2>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span style>Starting with the 1.5.50 release of OpenAFS for Windows, each

	command-line tools are Unicode enabled.&nbsp; No longer is OpenAFS restricted to 
	accessing file system objects whose names can be represented in the locale 
	specific OEM code page.&nbsp; This has significant benefits for end users.&nbsp; Most 
	importantly it permits non-Western languages to now be used for file system 
	object names in AFS from Microsoft Windows operating systems.&nbsp; Now that 
	Unicode names are supported, </span>
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming_user_profile"><span style>
	Roaming User Profiles</span></a><span style> and </span>
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folder_redirection"><span style>Folder

	library that can result in the AFS Client Service terminating prematurely.</b></li>

	the AFS Configuration Tool.</li>
	<li>The 1.5.58 release fixes a problem with server failover introduced in 
	the 1.5.53 release.</li>
	<li>The 1.5.59 release improves compatibility with the Windows SMB 
	redirector and boosts the priority class of the service to High to match the 
	priority of the system components depending on the timeliness of the service

<h3>Known Issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a *beta* AFS plug-in for Network Identity Manager is installed, it must 
be uninstalled before OpenAFS 1.5.59 is installed.  Otherwise, an error indicating that the plug-in cannot be installed because the appropriate version of 
OpenAFS is not installed will be generated.</li>
<li>The AFS plug-in for Network Identity Manager provided as part of OpenAFS 
1.5.59 requires MIT Kerberos for Windows 3.1 or above.</li>
<li>Directory and File Change Notifications are ignored when accessing AFS via 
UNC paths</li>
<li>Windows Vista Specific Issues<ul>
	<li>The help files provided with OpenAFS are in .HLP format.&nbsp;
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6ebcfad9-d3f5-4365-8070-334cd175d4bb&DisplayLang=en">WinHlp32.exe must be 
	downloaded separately from Microsoft.</a>&nbsp; Secure Endpoints Inc. is funding the 
development of compatible HtmlHelp (.CHM) files.</li>
	<li>The AFS Systray Tool (afscreds.exe) and AFS Control Panel (afs_config.exe) 
are not User Account Control (UAC) compatible.&nbsp; In order to start/stop the 
AFS service or to modify the configuration of the AFS client service they must 
be &quot;Run as Administrator&quot;.</li>

<p>Note: In 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows there are 64-bit and 32-bit versions 
of the command prompt and the Explorer Shell.&nbsp; It is very important that 
when installing applications that the installers be started from a 64-bit 
process.&nbsp; It is strongly recommended that the Add/Remove Programs Control 
Panel be used to initiate installations on 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating 
systems.</p>

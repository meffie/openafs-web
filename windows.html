<h1 style="text-align: center;">OpenAFS for Microsoft Windows®</h1>
OpenAFS is the world's foremost location independent file system.&nbsp;
With OpenAFS for Windows users of Microsoft Windows 2000, XP and 2003
(32-bit and 64-bit editions) can make the most of this proven data sharing
solution.&nbsp; The OpenAFS Project provides binary installation packages
appropriate for both individual users and organizations with thousands
of members.<br>

<br>
The following guidelines should be used for choosing an installer.  If you are upgrading
from a previous installation, select the same type of installer, EXE or MSI, as was 
previously installed on the system.  If you are installing for the first time, choose the
EXE if you are installing manually and the MSI if you either need to customize the 
installation package (via a transform) or wish to deploy via Active Directory Group Policy.
<p>
Each installer is provided in debug and non-debug versions.  The debug versions should
be installed only when you are already experiencing a problem and you need to assist
the OpenAFS developers in debuging the problem.  The non-debug version is optimized for
performance, does not generate logging information by default, and does not install 
symbol files.
<br>
<b>Digital Signatures:</b> All of the installers are produced and signed by <a href="https://www.secure-endpoints.com">
Secure Endpoints Inc.</a>.  If the signature is missing do not complete the installation 
process and send e-mail to <a href="mailto:openafs-security@openafs.org">openafs-security@openafs.org</a>

<h2><a name="stable">Current Stable Release: OpenAFS for Windows 1.4.1</a></h2>

  <li><a href="http://www.openafs.org/dl/openafs/1.4.1/winnt/frames.htm">1.4.1 Release Notes</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The pthread library, <b>afspthread.dll</b>, is not safe to unload.  This can cause a crash in applications which load AFS libraries and then unload them when they are no longer required.
<li>ANSI filename support is broken.
<li>Rapid creation and destruction of SMB virtual circuits can result in a deadlock that will require the AFS service to be terminated via the Task Manager and manually restarted.
<li>When the smb_SendPacket routine fails, it may release a reference to the SMB virtual circuit object that it doesn't hold.  This can result in a panic condition.
<li>There is a known deadlock condition between two locks in the SMB server.
<li><b>fs flushXXX</b> will cause the AFS cache manager to release references to the wrong stat cache entries.  This can cause some stat cache entries to never be freed and the resulting file system objects may become inaccessible.
<li>volume server failover does not work when mounting the 'root.afs' volume in the default cell.  (Freelance mode off.)
<li>The help files for the AFS system tray and control panel applications are inaccessible.
<li>Mount points to volumes that do not exist can result in a crash of the AFS client service.
<li>Over quota and Disk full errors are not returned to the caller.
<li>The Integrated Logon DLL can cause applications started by CreateProcessAsUser() to crash.  This is known to be a problem with remote installations performed by the System Management Service.
<li>Message Box dialogs displayed when a network failure is reported by the bound LAN adapter prevents the automatic restarting of the afsd_service.exe
<li>The Integrated Login DLL can cause winlogin.exe to produce a Windows blue screen if it is called with a Windows Domain that does not exist.  This can happen during a SysPrep operation.
<li>Accessing more than the maximum number of volumes (5000 by default) will result in a panic condition since volume entries are not recycled within the cache manager.
<li>The AFS Shell Extension does not always find its resource library resulting in a menu without text strings.
<li>An error in the generation of the BackConnectionHostNames registry value can trigger a bug in all versions of Windows that can deadlock the kernel during authentication attempts.
<li>The export list from <B>afsauthent.dll</b> is incorrect resulting in third party applications that call pr_End crashing.
<li>The winsock library is improperly initialized and released by the RX library causing random network errors in third party applications which load and unload the library as necessary.
<li>Directory searches performed by Windows Vista can fail as InfoLevels 0x105 and 0x0106 are not supported but no error is returned.

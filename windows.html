OpenAFS is the world's foremost location independent file system.&nbsp;
With OpenAFS for Windows, users of Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, 2003, XP64, Vista
(32-bit and 64-bit editions, Server 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit editions), Windows 7
(all editions), and Server 2008 R2 (all editions) can make the most of this proven data sharing
solution.&nbsp; The OpenAFS Project provides binary installation packages
appropriate for both individual users and organizations with thousands
of members.<br>

<h2><a name="whichversion">How to Decide Which Version to Install</a></h2>

<p>
OpenAFS.org maintains two active release series for the Microsoft Windows
platform, 1.6.x and 1.7.x.&nbsp; If life were simple, the 1.6 release series
would be the most recent production quality revision and the 1.7.x would be the
next generation release series that includes potentially experimental features
that have not received broad testing.&nbsp; Unfortunately when it comes to
OpenAFS on the Microsoft Windows platform life is not simple.</p>
<p>
Access to the \\AFS name space is acheived via the use of an SMB to AFS gateway
in the 1.6 series.&nbsp; This approach was developed when there were no
documented methods of adding networked file system to Microsoft Windows.&nbsp;
It worked quite well in Windows XP and Server 2003 but is highly unstable on
Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; Especially on systems that suspend and
resume or migrate between networks.</p>
<p>
The 1.7 series is a completely new approach.&nbsp; Instead of relying on the
Microsoft SMB client to interface with the Windows kernel, OpenAFS 1.7.x is a
native Windows file system that is compatible with all versions of Microsoft
Windows from XP SP3 to Windows 7 SP1 and Server 2008 R2 SP1.&nbsp; As a native
file system, 1.7 provides better performance, does not rely on a private
loopback interface to publish the SMB gateway service name, and most
importantly, permits the OpenAFS developers to fully control the file system
source code.&nbsp; No longer will OpenAFS be held hostage to the whims of
Microsoft when bugs in the SMB client negatively impact access to the
\\AFS name space.</p>
<p>
The choice is yours to make but the recommendation of OpenAFS is to deploy the
1.7 series client and submit bug reports if application incompatibilities are
uncovered.&nbsp; The OpenAFS developers have a long track record of promptly
fixing reported issues.</p>

when installing applications that the installers be started from a 64-bit

<h2><a name=kfw>MIT Kerberos for Windows</a></h2>
OpenAFS for Windows depends on
<a target="_self" href="http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/index.html">MIT
Kerberos for Windows (KFW)</a>&nbsp; to provide Kerberos 5 functionality.&nbsp;
The recommended version of KFW for <a href="#release">
	OpenAFS for Windows 1.6.0b</a> is version 3.2.2.
64-bit releases of KFW are available from
<a href="http://www.secure-endpoints.com/index.html#kfw">Secure Endpoints Inc.</a><p>KFW 3.2.2 ships
with Network Identity Manager version 1.3.1.
<a href="https://www.secure-endpoints.com/netidmgr/v2/index.html">Secure Endpoints provides version 2.0 as a free
update.</a></p>
&nbsp;<h2><a name="hotfix"></a>Microsoft Hotfixes</h2>
<p>Just as OpenAFS releases fixes on a continuous basis, so does Microsoft for their Windows products.
If they are security related or deemed to be critical to the entire user base these hot fixes are
pushed out via Microsoft's Windows Update service.  However, if the fix is considered to be relevant
only to a small user community, the hot fix is made available via a posting to
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com">Microsoft KnowledgeBase</a>.  When a new service pack is
issued all of the outstanding hot fixes are rolled up and regression tested together.</p>
<p>OpenAFS for Windows is highly dependent on the correct operation of Microsoft's SMB redirector
network file system driver and the Netbios communication stack.  Over the years there have been
a large number of bugs found and fixed within these two subsystems.  At the present time there
a hot fixes that have been issued by Microsoft which have yet to be bundled into a service pack
for XP 32-bit, XP 64-bit and Server 2003.&nbsp; Hot Fixes that are considered
critical for OpenAFS users are marked as such below.</p>

<P>
Yay! This is the second issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. The newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community. This issue has
coverage of the workshop.

<P>
As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

<P>
Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe &lt;<A
HREF="mailto:jason@rampaginggeek.com">jason@rampaginggeek.com</A>&gt; know
what you would like to see out of this newsletter.

OpenAFS 1.4.11rc1 was released on June, 11, 2009. It's expected to be the
last release from CVS. A transition to git will be made and 1.5.x releases
will come from that, with the current CVS HEAD becoming the starting point
for the next 1.5.x release. Tools will be needed and are being developed to
work with git. We obviously seek people to help us with git (and gerrit)
tools, the latter of which requires Java expertise. Many build system
changes are in place in the new 1.5.x tree, most for the better.

<P>
Testers are wanted. Reports of success or failure of the release candidate
should be sent to <A
HREF="mailto:openafs.info@openafs.org.">openafs.info@openafs.org.</A>

<P>
OpenAFS 1.5.60 was released on May 31, 2009. Source and binaries are
available from <EM>http:</EM>



<P>
The 1.5 branch is now dead. In preparation for the conversion to git, the
CVS HEAD was purged of anything that is not on 1.5, and the 1.5 and HEAD
branches were then synchronized. 1.5.61 will be cut from git once the head
is officially converted.

The Sixth Annual International AFS &amp; Kerberos Best Practices Workshop
was held at Stanford University on June 1-5, 2009.

<P>
Ref: <EM>http:</EM>



<P>
Despite a slightly smaller than usual attendance, OpenAFS administrators
and developers from a half dozen countries gathered at Stanford University
the first week in June for the sixth annual AFS &amp; Kerberos Best
Practices Workshop. As always, there were full-day classes in the use and
best practices of OpenAFS and Kerberos. Social activities included a
fantastic evening at the Computer History Museum and a BBQ dinner.
(Organizer Derrick Brashear commented, ``No blows were exchanged.''
However, there was much beer consumed.)

<P>
Great talks over two and a half days ranged from status reports and updates
on existing software to new toys, plus a repeat of last-year's favorite,
the troubleshooting panel. Keynotes were given by Roland Dowdeswell,
talking about how a hypothetical multi-national financial firm could use
Kerberos in their world-wide infrastructure, and Jim Morris, talking about
the origins of what's now called AFS. Slides from most talks are available
from the website (<EM>http:</EM>).

<P>
Plans are already underway for the seventh Workshop, to be held May 24-28,
2010, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We hope to see you
there.

Fedora 11 contains updates to the kernel and glibc which means that OpenAFS
1.4.10 will neither build, nor run correctly. Prebuilt binary and source
RPMs containing the necessary patches are available from the OpenAFS
website, or simply install
<EM>http:</EM>
and run 'yum install kmod-openafs openafs-client openafs-krb5' to install
an OpenAFS client.

<P>
If you wish to use an existing source tarball on Fedora 11, then you will
need to grab the deltas STABLE14-dprintf-rename-20090427 and
STABLE14-linux26-defer-cred-changing-20090511 from
<EM>http:</EM> . The forthcoming 1.4.11 release will contain both of these fixes.

As has been heavily trailed, our change over from CVS to git for revision
control is almost upon us. Along with the new revision control system, we
also intend to make use of Google's gerrit code review tool. Gerrit will
provide a mechanism by which anyone in the community may submit, review and
comment upon forthcoming code changes. More details, and a sneak preview of
what is to come, are available in

With the arrival of Fedora 11, we say goodbye to Fedora 7. No new binary
builds for OpenAFS on Fedora 7 will be produced. This is a significantly
longer life than Fedora themselves provide for releases, but please do let
us know if this will cause problems. We currently automatically build RPMs
for all kernels on both ix86 and x86_64 architectures for Fedora 8, Fedora
9, Fedora 10, Fedora 11, RHEL4 and RHEL5. All these packages are available
from the OpenAFS site.

Progress is good. We have a second issue of the newsletter. I received
positive feedback from multiple people. Even one of our very active
contributors was surprised by how much was going on. This means that the
newsletter is serving a valuable purpose.

Current work in re-ordering the server preferences list takes into account
four things. Timeout time from the server, the round-trip time smoothed to
allow for short-term network hiccups, and the ratio between packets send
and the packets that needed to be resent. Work is still being done to
decide how the rank should be scaled for each of these variables, but this
may get pushed back until later, as the goal at this point is to get
something working. Things in the pipeline: How this affects initial rank
after boot-time, having the ranking be adjusted at some time interval, data
available to be inferred from the application layers, and the windows
client.

I'm intending to make something available this week to make sure it's
installing fine and so forth. Last week I didn't really do much since I was
at the workshop, though it was nice to get a few questions about the
project.

<P>
I've probably done more work prior to Google Summer of Code's official
coding start time. In that time, I've researched how to tie the MMC
framework to Windows Forms, how to install and register an MMC snap-in
assembly, and simply looked into how the MMC framework is architected. I've
also looked at authoring an MSC console.

In brief, we have finished three kAFS pioctl operations and have several
pioctls partially implemented. I have read some of the OpenAFS documents
and I am becoming more familiar with kAFS and OpenAFS as the project
progresses.

<P>
With the help of my mentor, I have built an environment with one OpenAFS
server, one OpenAFS client and one kAFS client for development and testing,
and I have become familiar with the tools and development environments,
e.g. git and the formatting of kernel patches. I have learnt a lot about
OpenAFS and dealing with open source projects, since the Linux kAFS GSoC
project started. Next, I will work to accelerate the completion of the rest
of the pioctl operations.

RXOSD is an extension for OpenAFS to allow file data to be put into
dedicated ``object storage'', which is arbitrarly spread across servers.
Among other things, this allows read/write replication of data. An
enhancement to the basic object storage paradigm is the ability to
transparently archive and restore data to and from HSM systems, similar to
the way MR-AFS used to facilitate. Hartmut Reuter and Christof Hanke (both
RZG) and Felix Frank (DESY) work on the integration of this extension of
OpenAFS. Patches submitted to the OpenAFS-Gatekeepers are aimed to be small
and amount to no more than one change each. Everyone interested in RXOSD
and/or its integration into OpenAFS is cordially invited to send an email
to the integrators or the openafs-info mailing list.

<P>
Ref: <EM>https:</EM>



<P>
Concerning vicep-access I can tell you that this will come into OpenAFS
along with RXOSD because it's just another protocol supported by the
restructured client. However, it's ifdefed and configured separately so
that it could be used independently from RXOSD. But, of course, it makes
more sense to use it along with RXOSD because filesystems such as Lustre
and GPFS are good for large files, but slow for file creation and deletion.
So you would prefer to keep the small files in the fileserver's local
partition.

Thanks to contributions from Steven Jenkins and Mike Robinson of End Point,
our man page coverage is now essentially complete. Every OpenAFS command
has a corresponding man page.

<P>
Thanks to Jeff Altman of Your File System, Inc., the old IBM architecture
and protocol documentation has been converted to header files with Doxygen
comments, allowing us to generate that documentation from editable source
and eventually better integrate it with the OpenAFS source. This work was
funded under a SBIR grant.

<P>
The build system for the OpenAFS manuals has been overhauled to use more
current tools. We now generate Windows Help files from the same source as
well as much better HTML and PDF output and get the version number for the
manual from the OpenAFS build system.

<P>
Thanks to edits by Jason Edgecombe and reviews by Jeffrey Altman and Russ
Allbery, chapter 1 of the Admin Guide has been updated to give warnings
about kaserver and include Kerberos 5.

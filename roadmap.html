<h1 align="center">Road Map / Development Wish List for OpenAFS</h1>
<p>In its fifteen-plus years as an open-source project, OpenAFS has made
great progress and proved to be a mature project, providing clients
and servers on all UNIX/Linux variants.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="release_schedule"></a>Road Map</h1>
<p align="left">As an independent open-source project, OpenAFS has no paid staff or
full-time developers to maintain the software and add new features.  The
contributions of volunteers drive the pace of progress, so there cannot be
fixed timelines for future plans.  Regardless, there is still an overarching
plan for the desired trend of future development, with major features and
milestones to be reached.  Please send inquiries, comments, and offers of support to
<a href="mailto:openafs-gatekeepers@openafs.org?subject=OpenAFS Roadmap Feedback">
openafs-gatekeepers@openafs.org</a>. Where external contributors have promised
contributions, they are included, as are timelines when those are provided.
The following release schedule is subject to change.</p>

<h2 align="left">1.6.19</h2>
<p>The next release in the stable series for Unix will bring additional incremental
improvements in line with previous stable branch releases. Most noteworthy,
it will include fixes that prevent cases where a database write could be lost
or an old version of the database be used instead of the latest version.</p>
<p>The 1.6 stable release series is nearing the end of its development lifecycle;
development resources are shifting to the forthcoming 1.8 release series.
Non-invasive bugfixes and OS support will continue to be merged to the 1.6
series, with OS support expected to drive the release schedule.</p>
<p>No firm end-of-life date is yet set, as that will depend on the timeline for
the 1.8 release to be available.</p>

<h2 align="left">1.7.33</h2>
<p>The 1.7.33 release is the latest release from the 1.7 series of stable
releases for Windows clients.  No additional releases from this series
are currently planned.</p>
<p>Starting from the 1.7.32 release, 1.7-series releases are only distributed
from <a href="/">openafs.org</a> in source form.  Pre-built installers are
available from third-party organzations.</p>

<h2 align="left">1.8</h2>
<p>Preparation for a new stable release series for Unix has begun.
This release will bring a wide variety of improvements and features that
have been developed on the master branch for the past several years.
In addition to the general code cleanup that has accumulated,
it will include support for pthreaded database servers, shared libraries
built with libtool, and use the crypto and roken libraries from Heimdal,
eliminating the broad reliance on libkrb5 for rxkad-k5 support.  The
Rx protocol performance is improved, and private structures have been
removed from the public header files.  The most recent status update
for this release was posted to openafs-devel is available
<a href="https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2016-September/020355.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 align="left">1.9</h2>
<p>The 1.9 series will be an experimental release series, producing
a rapidly updating set of releases to facilitate access to the features
being developed for the 2.0 release.

<h2 align="left">2.0</h2>
<p>One of the goals of the 1.8 release is to open up the tree for
more invasive (and more rewarding) feature development.  One long-desired
feature that is expected to be in 2.0 is the rxgk Rx security class;
some preliminary changes toward that feature are in gerrit waiting
for review.  Other desired features such as IPv6 support are listed
below, but as always, are contingent on the contributions of
volunteers and companies to make them happen.</p>

<h1 align="center">Development Wish List</h1>

<h2 wrap><a name="modernization"></a>Modernization of crypto and network support</h2>
<p>Over the years, the AFS protocol has not kept up with developments in
cryptography and network protocols, sticking with single-DES-grade encryption
and remaining an IPv4-only service.  The 2013 security release moved
the long-term krb5 cell-wide keys off of single-DES, but wire encryption
remains unchanged since the original AFS release.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>rxgk</strong>
<p>rxgk is the long-established new security class that uses the GSSAPI
for authentication and RFC 3961 cryptography for wire encryption and
integrity checking.  The use of the RFC 3961 framework allows for new
cryptographic methods to be introduced without additional protocol
changes.</p>
<p>Work towards rxgk has already begun, but some major pieces remain
to be designed.  In particular, the cache manager needs to be rearchitected
to support the separation of connections to database servers and
connections to fileservers; before connecting to a fileserver, the cache
manager must first connect to a vlserver and learn about the fileserver.
On the server side, a new vldb format must be designed to store the
extended fileserver information and track which fileservers are rxgk-capable;
the prdb should have mechanisms to store extended authentication names
from arbitrary GSS-API clients.  A procedure must be developed
(and software to support it) for a seamless transition from an
existing deployment to using rxgk for server-to-server communication
and enable rxgk for client usage.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>IPv6</strong>
<p>At present, OpenAFS represents IP addresses as uint32.  This
is fundamentally incompatible with IPv6, which is increasingly becoming
a necessary part of the Internet ecosystem.  In order to remain
a fully viable solution, OpenAFS must develop support for at least
clients with IPv6 addresses, but also for servers with IPv6 addresses
as well.</p>
<p>The path to proper IPv6 support in the client is fairly clear:
first, to convert
all variables that hold IP addresses to be a distince type specific
to IP addresses, then to convert that type to a structure containing
the IPv4 address and use accessor routines for all operations with it,
then adapt the accessors to be compatible with IPv6 addresses and
abstract away address-family specific knowledge from the code that
interacts with the accessors.  On the server side, though,
additional database work is needed to support storing multiple types
of adderess, and RPCs developed to manage them.
No commitments have been made for contributions toward this goal.</p>

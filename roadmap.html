<h1>Development Roadmap for OpenAFS</h1>

<h2>Pending issues for OpenAFS 1.2 releases</h2>
The following are items known to be in progress, and, where available, a point of contact.
<dl>
<dt><p>"CopyOnWrite" bug</p></dt>
<dd><p>The "namei" fileserver (used on Linux but not by default on Solaris, AIX, IRIX or Tru64/Digital Unix) is known to corrupt data under circumstances which have not become entirely clear yet. What is known is that generally after a volume clone (such as is caused by vos backup) a later write will log a "CopyOnWrite" failure, and the corrupted volume will be taken offline. After OpenAFS 1.2.3 a bug was found which at the time was believed to be related, however it has not yet been proven to fix the problem. The fix is, however, included in OpenAFS 1.2.5. If you believe you are experiencing this problem, and especially if you can reproduce it, please contact Derrick Brashear (shadow@dementia.org).
</dd>
<dt><p>Windows NT server</p></dt>
<dd><p>Had problem with paths in the installation as of 1.2.2b release. Fix integrated but not yet available in a release.</p>
</dd>
<dt><p>Linux .__afsXXXX file creation</p></dt>
<dd><p>Believed to be introduced with changes to the Linux client in OpenAFS 1.2.3. 
</dd>
<dt><p>Linux vcache NULL pointer dereference</p></dt>
<dd><p>Fix is present in CVS but not in a release yet.
</dd>
<dt><p>Linux lost wakeups</p></dt>
<dd><p>As issue is known, a proposed fix is on-hand and will be integrated when it can be assured it causes no other problems.
</dd>
<dt><p>Windows symlink behavior</p></dt>
<dd><p>Known to be flawed; No known fixes.
</dd>
</dl>


<h2>To be addressed in 1.3 before 1.4 is forked</h2>
The following are items which involve fundamental behavior changes or are not expected to be advanced enough to be included in 1.2 releases.

<dl>
<dt><p>Fakestat</p></dt>
<dd><p>The cache manager can fake mountpoint directory information so clients which stat all of /afs will not need to time out all the cells. Not yet tested on all platforms, and will not fix MacOS X Finder issues.
</dd>

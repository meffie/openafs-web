<h1>Welcome to the home of OpenAFS</h1>

<h2>What is AFS?</h2>
<p>AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon 
University and supported and developed as a product by Transarc 
Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server architecture
for file sharing, providing location independence, scalability and 
transparent migration capabilities for data.</p>
<p>IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the release 
OpenAFS.</p>

<dd><p>The OpenAFS Gatekeepers are pleased to announce the
release of version 1.4.0 of OpenAFS. This version incorporates
hundreds of enhancements and improvements since the 1.2 series. Many
bugs and programming inefficiencies (some of which have been present
since IBM's donation of AFS to the open source community) have been
eliminated, resulting in a much more stable product. Improvements for
Windows users are particularly dramatic.

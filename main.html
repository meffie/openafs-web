<h1>Welcome to the home of OpenAFS</h1>

<h2>What is AFS?</h2>
<p>AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at
Carnegie Mellon University and supported and developed as a product by
Transarc Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server
architecture for federated file sharing and replicated read-only content
distribution, providing location independence, scalability,
security, and transparent migration capabilities.  AFS is available
for a broad range of heterogeneous systems including UNIX, Linux,
&nbsp;<a href="macos.html">MacOS X</a>, and <a href="windows.html">Microsoft Windows</a></p>
<p>IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the release
OpenAFS.</p>

<h2>OpenAFS Foundation</h2>

<p>The OpenAFS Foundation is dedicated to fostering the stability and growth of
OpenAFS by providing strategic direction and aiming to raise money to support
the development and maintenance of OpenAFS. More information on the Foundation
can be found <a href="http://openafsfoundation.org" target="_top">on the
OpenAFS Foundation website</a>.</p>

<h4>20 September 2015 - OpenAFS adopts Contributor Covenant as code of conduct</h4>
<p>In the interest of fostering a friendly, welcoming environment for contributors, we have introduced the Contributor Covenant as the code of conduct for the OpenAFS Project.

For additional information, visit <A HREF="http://contributor-covenant.org">contributor-covenant.org</A>

<h4>17-September-2015 - OpenAFS 1.6.14.1 - Maintenance release for UNIX/Linux</h4>
<p>OpenAFS 1.6.14.1 is the next in the current series of OpenAFS stable releases
for UNIX/Linux systems. It adds client support for Linux kernel 4.2 .

Note that due to changes to internal data structures with this kernel release,
the OpenAFS client can no longer reset the link count during path
lookups. Since volume root directories must behave like symlinks
instead of normal directories in order to satisfy Linux kernel
invariants, looking up paths containing more than 40 mount points
will fail with ELOOP on such kernels.

There are no further changes. Systems not affected by the Linux 4.2 VFS changes can
continue to use the OpenAFS 1.6.14 release.

<h4>13-August-2015 - OpenAFS 1.6.14 - Maintenance release for UNIX/Linux</h4>
<p>OpenAFS 1.6.14 is the next in the current series of OpenAFS stable releases
for UNIX/Linux systems. It is limited to a fix for an issue introduced in release 1.6.13:

Prior to the OpenAFS security release 1.6.13, the Volume Location Server (vlserver) RPC
VL_ListAttributesN2() supported wildcard volume name lookups via regular expression (regex)
pattern matching. This support was completely disabled in 1.6.13 because it was judged to be
a security risk due to buffer overruns in the implementation, as well as the possibility of
denial of service attacks where certain regular expressions could cause excessive CPU usage
in some regex implementations. After 1.6.13 was released, it was discovered that the native
OpenAFS 'backup' system uses the VL_ListAttributesN2() regex support to evaluate configured
volume sets.
<p>
As a result of this issue, OpenAFS 1.6.14 replaces the 1.6.13 changes to  VL_ListAttributesN2.
1.6.14 prevents the buffer overruns and reenables  the regex support, but restricts it to
OpenAFS super-users and -localauth only. This is sufficient to restore the OpenAFS 'backup'
system's ability to work correctly with any previously supported volume set. The OpenAFS
'backup' commands are already documented to require super-user authorization,
so this restriction is moot for the backup system.
i<p>
None of the other security fixes in OpenAFS 1.6.13 are known to have any issues, and are still
included unchanged in OpenAFS 1.6.14.

<p>OpenAFS 1.7.31 is the next a series of OpenAFS clients for the
Microsoft Windows platform that is implemented as a native file system.&nbsp;
Significant changes since 1.7.30:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes a variety of rare errors that can lead to data corruption.
    <ul>
      <li>one specific to synchronous file writes on Server 2012 R2.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>File copies from readonly volumes could fail with a Media Protected error due to failure of the afs redirector to permit setting file position on a readonly file handle. </li>
  <li>Prevent applications from unintentionally clearing the Reparse Point or Directory attribute when setting other attributes on files and directories.</li>
  <li> If a file has the DOS readonly attribute set, deny
    all writes, truncations, and overwrites in the
    redirector and not the afsd_service.  Waiting for the
    afsd_service to see the store operation is too late.
  The Windows cache manager has already accepted the data.</li>
  <li>  Fix a potential BSOD when afs redirector trace is enabled.</li>
  <li>Improved support for applications that set the Last Modified Timestamp to -1 to indicate that the timestamp should not be modified.</li>
</ul>
	<p><strong>All users of previous 1.7 releases should upgrade.</strong></p>
<p>The 1.7 series is for Microsoft Windows only.</p>

<p>Concurrent with the expected release of MacOS Lion, an initial version of
  OpenAFS is now available. More details are available on the
  <a href="macos.html">MacOS page</a>.</p>


<h4>23-Feb-2011 - CVE-2011-0431 corrections</h4>
<p>OpenAFS 1.4.14 NOT vulnerable
&nbsp;&nbsp;
CVE-2011-0431, while correctly describing 1.4.14 as containing the fix
for this issue, describes in its summary the release as broken. It is not.
We recommend sites upgrade to 1.4.14; However, the impact of the issue
is limited to a denial of service attack by a user with the ability to
affect a lock of AFS though the client on a host.</p>

<h4>23-Feb-2011 - OpenAFS Security Advisory 2011-001</h4>
<p>OpenAFS servers versions 1.2.8 - 1.4.12.1, 1.5.0-1.5.74 for all platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;
An attacker with control of a client, or the ability to forge RX packets,
can crash a server of affected hosts.
This vulnerability is being tracked as CVE-2011-0430.

Currently the advisory erroneously states 1.4.14 is vulnerable.</p>

	<h4>9-Jul-2009 - OpenAFS Changes Source Code Version Control System to Git</h4>
	<p>After more than eighteen months of attempts to migrate source code management
away from cvs OpenAFS has finally converted to Git.  This change will not have
any visible impact on end users.  For developers there are major changes in
the tools required to work with the OpenAFS source repository and the workflow
used to submit contributions to OpenAFS.  Along with the conversion to Git,
OpenAFS is now using the Gerrit source code review application which makes it
significantly easier for developers to review and comment on each other's
contributions.</p>

<h4>20-Mar-2007 - OpenAFS Security Advisory 2007-001</h4>
<p>Unix clients in OpenAFS versions before 1.5.17 and 1.4.4
allow a potential privilege escalation via setuid functionality which
can be enabled by the client administration but is enabled by default

<h4>28-Dec-2006 - OpenAFS Elders announce "No More DES" roadmap</h4>
<p>
AFSv3 was designed and implemented during the late 80s and early 90s when the
state of the art in distributed computer authentication and data confidentiality
was to use Kerberos 4 and the United States' Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Over the last two years the U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology
(NIST) has withdrawn the DES standard and MIT has announced the end of life of
Kerberos 4.  In response, the OpenAFS Elders have approved a roadmap to transition
from DES to stronger ciphers which includes the deprecation of the OpenAFS kaserver.</p>

</ul>


<h4>6-Dec-2006 - pam-afs-session 1.0 released</h4>
<p>
pam-afs-session is a PAM module intended for use with a Kerberos v5 PAM module to
obtain an AFS PAG and AFS tokens on login. It puts every new session in a PAG
regardless of whether it was authenticated with Kerberos and runs a configurable
external program to obtain tokens. It supports using Heimdal's libkafs for the AFS
interface and falls back to an internal Linux-only implementation if libkafs isn't
available.</p>

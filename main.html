<h1>Welcome to the home of OpenAFS</h1>

<h2>What is AFS?</h2>
<p>AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at
Carnegie Mellon University and supported and developed as a product by 
Transarc Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server 
architecture for federated file sharing and replicated read-only content
distribution, providing location independence, scalability,
security, and transparent migration capabilities.  AFS is available 
for a broad range of heterogeneous systems including UNIX, Linux, 
<a href="macos.html">MacOS X</a>, and <a href="windows.html">Microsoft Windows</a></p>
<p>IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the release 
OpenAFS.</p>

<dt>28-Mar-2011 - OpenAFS 1.6.0 prerelease 4 available</dt>
<dd>OpenAFS 1.6.0 prerelease 4 is the fourth candidate for the OpenAFS
1.6.0 release.
<p>The 1.6 series is intended to provide new features including the Demand Attach File Service and Disconnected AFS, on other platforms including MacOS X, Linux variants, and UNIX, and includes numerous new features since 1.5.72, especially for users of MacOS X. OSX users may find that 1.6 series provides a dramatically better usage experience than the current suggested production version.
<p>Sites using 1.6.0 prereleases for fileservers are urged to upgrade to 1.6.0pre4!

<dt>23-Feb-2011 - CVE-2011-0431 corrections</dt>
<dd>OpenAFS 1.4.14 NOT vulnerable
&nbsp;&nbsp;
CVE-2011-0431, while correctly describing 1.4.14 as containing the fix
for this issue, describes in its summary the release as broken. It is not.
We recommend sites upgrade to 1.4.14; However, the impact of the issue
is limited to a denial of service attack by a user with the ability to
affect a lock of AFS though the client on a host.
</dd>
<dt>23-Feb-2011 - OpenAFS Security Advisory 2011-001</dt>
<dd>OpenAFS servers versions 1.2.8 - 1.4.12.1, 1.5.0-1.5.74 for all platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
An attacker with control of a client, or the ability to forge RX packets,
can crash a server of affected hosts.
This vulnerability is being tracked as CVE-2011-0430. 

Currently the advisory erroneously states 1.4.14 is vulnerable.

<dt>4-Nov-2010 - OpenAFS 1.5.78 released</dt>
<dd>OpenAFS 1.5.78 is the twelfth release of OpenAFS for Windows 7 and Server 
2008 R2 and provides the best user experience for users on all supported 
Microsoft Windows platforms. 1.4.12 is the suggested production release for all other 
users. Due to data loss issues present in all versions of OpenAFS prior to 
1.5.62 and believed to be in IBM AFS, all Windows users are urged to upgrade.

<p>1.5.78 is also the most recent in the series of releases intended to provide new experimental features including the Demand Attach File Service and Disconnected AFS, on other platforms including MacOS X, Linux variants, and UNIX, and includes numerous new features since 1.5.72, especially for users of MacOS X. OSX users may find that 1.5.78 provides a dramatically better usage experience than the current suggested production version.

	<dt>9-Jul-2009 - OpenAFS Changes Source Code Version Control System to Git</dt>
	<dd>After more than eighteen months of attempts to migrate source code management
away from cvs OpenAFS has finally converted to Git.  This change will not have 
any visible impact on end users.  For developers there are major changes in 
the tools required to work with the OpenAFS source repository and the workflow
used to submit contributions to OpenAFS.  Along with the conversion to Git, 
OpenAFS is now using the Gerrit source code review application which makes it
significantly easier for developers to review and comment on each other's 
contributions.

<dt>28-Dec-2006 - OpenAFS Elders announce "No More DES" roadmap</dt>
<dd>
AFSv3 was designed and implemented during the late 80s and early 90s when the 
state of the art in distributed computer authentication and data confidentiality 
was to use Kerberos 4 and the United States' Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Over the last two years the U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) has withdrawn the DES standard and MIT has announced the end of life of
Kerberos 4.  In response, the OpenAFS Elders have approved a roadmap to transition
from DES to stronger ciphers which includes the deprecation of the OpenAFS kaserver.

<dt>6-Dec-2006 - pam-afs-session 1.0 released</dt>

pam-afs-session is a PAM module intended for use with a Kerberos v5 PAM module to 
obtain an AFS PAG and AFS tokens on login. It puts every new session in a PAG 
regardless of whether it was authenticated with Kerberos and runs a configurable 
external program to obtain tokens. It supports using Heimdal's libkafs for the AFS 
interface and falls back to an internal Linux-only implementation if libkafs isn't 
available.

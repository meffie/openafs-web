<h1>Welcome to the home of OpenAFS</h1>

<h2>What is AFS?</h2>
<p>AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at
Carnegie Mellon University and supported and developed as a product by 
Transarc Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server 
architecture for file sharing, providing location independence, scalability,
security, and transparent migration capabilities for data.</p>
<p>IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the release 
OpenAFS.</p>

<dt>28-Dec-2006 - OpenAFS Elders announce "No More DES" roadmap</dt>
<dd><p>
AFSv3 was designed and implemented during the late 80s and early 90s when the 
state of the art in distributed computer authentication and data confidentiality 
was to use Kerberos 4 and the United States' Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Over the last two years the U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) has withdrawn the DES standard and MIT has announced the end of life of
Kerberos 4.  In response, the OpenAFS Elders have approved a roadmap to transition
from DES to stronger ciphers which includes the deprecation of the OpenAFS kaserver.

<dt>6-Dec-2006 - pam-afs-session 1.0 released</dt>
<dd><p>
pam-afs-session is a PAM module intended for use with a Kerberos v5 PAM module to 
obtain an AFS PAG and AFS tokens on login. It puts every new session in a PAG 
regardless of whether it was authenticated with Kerberos and runs a configurable 
external program to obtain tokens. It supports using Heimdal's libkafs for the AFS 
interface and falls back to an internal Linux-only implementation if libkafs isn't 
available.

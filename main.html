<h1>Welcome to the home of OpenAFS</h1>

<h2>What is AFS?</h2>
AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon 
University and supported and developed as a product by Transarc 
Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server architecture
for file sharing, providing location independence, scalability and 
transparent migration capabilities for data.

<h2>What is OpenAFS?</h2>
IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the release 
OpenAFS. It's available from
<A HREF="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/" target="_top">the IBM Open Source site.</a>

<h2>What is openafs.org, then?</h2>
The openafs.org site is for coordination and distribution of ongoing OpenAFS 
development.

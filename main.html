<h1>Welcome to the home of OpenAFS</h1>

<h2>What is AFS?</h2>
<p>AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at
Carnegie Mellon University and supported and developed as a product by
Transarc Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server
architecture for federated file sharing and replicated read-only content
distribution, providing location independence, scalability,
security, and transparent migration capabilities.  AFS is available
for a broad range of heterogeneous systems including UNIX, Linux,
&nbsp;<a href="macos.html">MacOS X</a>, and <a href="windows.html">Microsoft Windows</a></p>
<p>IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the release
OpenAFS.</p>

<h4>4-Mar-2013 - OpenAFS Security Advisory 2013-001</h4>
<p>OpenAFS servers versions before 1.6.2 for all platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;
An attacker with the ability to manipulate AFS directory ACLs may crash the
fileserver hosting that volume. In addition, once a corrupt ACL is placed
on a fileserver, its existence may crash client utilities manipulating ACLs
on that server.

<h4>14-Jul-2011 - OpenAFS available for MacOS 10.7 (Lion)</h4>
<p>Concurrent with the expected release of MacOS Lion, an initial version of
  OpenAFS is now available. More details are available on the
  <a href="macos.html">MacOS page</a>.</p>


<h4>23-Feb-2011 - CVE-2011-0431 corrections</h4>
<p>OpenAFS 1.4.14 NOT vulnerable
&nbsp;&nbsp;
CVE-2011-0431, while correctly describing 1.4.14 as containing the fix
for this issue, describes in its summary the release as broken. It is not.
We recommend sites upgrade to 1.4.14; However, the impact of the issue
is limited to a denial of service attack by a user with the ability to
affect a lock of AFS though the client on a host.</p>

<h4>23-Feb-2011 - OpenAFS Security Advisory 2011-001</h4>
<p>OpenAFS servers versions 1.2.8 - 1.4.12.1, 1.5.0-1.5.74 for all platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;
An attacker with control of a client, or the ability to forge RX packets,
can crash a server of affected hosts.
This vulnerability is being tracked as CVE-2011-0430.

Currently the advisory erroneously states 1.4.14 is vulnerable.</p>

	<h4>28-Aug-2009 - Data Loss in Pre-1.5.62 OpenAFS for Windows Releases</h4>
	<p>
	Releases of OpenAFS for Windows prior 1.5.62 may fail to store data
to file servers.  There are two issues that are addressed in the
1.5.62 release.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Failure to Store Portions of Unaligned Writes
		<li>Failure to Store Data to File Servers Lacking Large File Support

	<h4>9-Jul-2009 - OpenAFS Changes Source Code Version Control System to Git</h4>
	<p>After more than eighteen months of attempts to migrate source code management
away from cvs OpenAFS has finally converted to Git.  This change will not have
any visible impact on end users.  For developers there are major changes in
the tools required to work with the OpenAFS source repository and the workflow
used to submit contributions to OpenAFS.  Along with the conversion to Git,
OpenAFS is now using the Gerrit source code review application which makes it
significantly easier for developers to review and comment on each other's
contributions.</p>

may be possible for an attacker to cause the kernel to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is being tracked as CVE-2009-1251.</p>

<h4>19-Apr-2007 - OpenAFS Security Advisory 2007-002</h4>
<p>
OpenAFS for Windows clients versions 1.3.64 - 1.3.99, 1.4.0 - 1.4.4, 1.5.0 - 1.5.18.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When MIT Kerberos for Windows (any version) is installed
a user with the ability to alter the contents of the Kerberos v5 configuration
profile can prevent Microsoft Windows from successfully booting.&nbsp; This
issue has been corrected in OpenAFS 1.5.19.</p>

<h4>20-Mar-2007 - OpenAFS Security Advisory 2007-001</h4>
<p>Unix clients in OpenAFS versions before 1.5.17 and 1.4.4
allow a potential privilege escalation via setuid functionality which
can be enabled by the client administration but is enabled by default
for the client's local cell. To avoid this issue, 1.5.17 and 1.4.4 have been
issued with setuid disabled by default in all cases.</p>

<h4>28-Dec-2006 - OpenAFS Elders announce "No More DES" roadmap</h4>
<p>
AFSv3 was designed and implemented during the late 80s and early 90s when the
state of the art in distributed computer authentication and data confidentiality
was to use Kerberos 4 and the United States' Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Over the last two years the U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology
(NIST) has withdrawn the DES standard and MIT has announced the end of life of
Kerberos 4.  In response, the OpenAFS Elders have approved a roadmap to transition
from DES to stronger ciphers which includes the deprecation of the OpenAFS kaserver.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="no-more-des.html">Go to the announcement</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>6-Dec-2006 - pam-afs-session 1.0 released</h4>
<p>
pam-afs-session is a PAM module intended for use with a Kerberos v5 PAM module to
obtain an AFS PAG and AFS tokens on login. It puts every new session in a PAG
regardless of whether it was authenticated with Kerberos and runs a configurable
external program to obtain tokens. It supports using Heimdal's libkafs for the AFS
interface and falls back to an internal Linux-only implementation if libkafs isn't
available.</p>

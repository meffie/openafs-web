<h1>Welcome to the home of OpenAFS</h1>

<h2>What is AFS?</h2>
<p>AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at
Carnegie Mellon University and supported and developed as a product by 
Transarc Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server 
architecture for federated file sharing and replicated read-only content
distribution, providing location independence, scalability,
security, and transparent migration capabilities.  AFS is available 
for a broad range of heterogeneous systems including UNIX, Linux, 
<a href="macos.html">MacOS X</a>, and <a href="windows.html">Microsoft Windows</a></p>
<p>IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the release 
OpenAFS.</p>

<dd>
OpenAFS for Windows clients versions 1.3.64 - 1.3.99, 1.4.0 - 1.4.4, 1.5.0 - 1.5.18.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When MIT Kerberos for Windows (any version) is installed
a user with the ability to alter the contents of the Kerberos v5 configuration
profile can prevent Microsoft Windows from successfully booting.&nbsp; This 
issue has been corrected in OpenAFS 1.5.19.

<dt>20-Mar-2007 - OpenAFS Security Advisory 2007-001</dt>
<dd>Unix clients in OpenAFS versions before 1.5.17 and 1.4.4 
allow a potential privilege escalation via setuid functionality which
can be enabled by the client administration but is enabled by default
for the client's local cell. To avoid this issue, 1.5.17 and 1.4.4 have been
issued with setuid disabled by default in all cases.

<dt>28-Dec-2006 - OpenAFS Elders announce "No More DES" roadmap</dt>
<dd>
AFSv3 was designed and implemented during the late 80s and early 90s when the 
state of the art in distributed computer authentication and data confidentiality 
was to use Kerberos 4 and the United States' Data Encryption Standard (DES).
Over the last two years the U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) has withdrawn the DES standard and MIT has announced the end of life of
Kerberos 4.  In response, the OpenAFS Elders have approved a roadmap to transition
from DES to stronger ciphers which includes the deprecation of the OpenAFS kaserver.

<dt>6-Dec-2006 - pam-afs-session 1.0 released</dt>
<dd>
pam-afs-session is a PAM module intended for use with a Kerberos v5 PAM module to 
obtain an AFS PAG and AFS tokens on login. It puts every new session in a PAG 
regardless of whether it was authenticated with Kerberos and runs a configurable 
external program to obtain tokens. It supports using Heimdal's libkafs for the AFS 
interface and falls back to an internal Linux-only implementation if libkafs isn't 
available.

<h1>Welcome to the home of OpenAFS</h1>

<h2>What is AFS?</h2>
AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon 
University and supported and developed as a product by Transarc 
Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server architecture
for file sharing, providing location independence, scalability and 
transparent migration capabilities for data.<br>
IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the release 
OpenAFS.

<dt>18-Oct-2004 - OpenAFS 1.3.73 Released!</dt>
<dd><p>OpenAFS 1.3.73 represents the current state of development efforts, and is now the stable Windows 2000/XP/2003 client. For Unix platforms, 1.2.11 is still the stable release. However, 1.3.73 is a milestone on the release path to 1.4.0, and we're looking for serious testing. Note: the earlier 1.3.72 source should be considered withdrawn. The 1.3.72 Windows client matches this one exactly, only a cvs commit error and the resulting distributed source was affected.

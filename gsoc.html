<h1>Project Ideas for Google's Summer of Code 2008</h1>
<p>OpenAFS is a 100% open source globally distributed file system derived from 
IBM AFS commercial offering as of 1 November 2008.&nbsp; Since IBM released the 
source code OpenAFS has thrived adding support for new platforms while enhancing 
its overall performance, scalability and usability.&nbsp; </p>
<p>OpenAFS is a very large and highly complex software project consisting of 
close to one million lines of source code that is severely under documented.&nbsp; 
As a result it takes a long time for any developers to become proficient 
contributors to the core systems.&nbsp; Given the time frames associated with 
Google Summer of Code the proposed ideas are primarily projects which exist on 
the periphery of the code base but are nevertheless crucial to an improved end 
user experience.</p>
<h2>Project Idea 1: Microsoft Windows Explorer Shell User Interface Extensions</h2>
<p>In order for end users to be comfortable using AFS, the Explorer Shell must 
provide the same level of functionality that exists for CIFS and local file 
systems.&nbsp; Selecting an object should display a summary of the object's meta 
data; the table view should provide options for displaying ACLs, UNIX mode bits, 
the owner, group information, symlink and mount point targets; the properties 
dialog should permit interactive modification to meta data values when the user 
has the appropriate permissions.&nbsp; All in all, the user should not notice 
that AFS is not a native part of the operating system and the user interface.</p>
<p>Mockups of proposals for the Explorer Shell extension can be found at
<a href="http://www.secure-endpoints.com/openafs-windows-roadmap.html#shell extensions">
http://www.secure-endpoints.com/openafs-windows-roadmap.html#shell extensions</a>.&nbsp; 
This project consists of multiple components that can be successfully 
implemented one at a time.&nbsp; The successful completion of this project does 
not require that all of the proposed extensions be implemented.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This project does not require any prior knowledge of AFS nor any knowledge of 
OpenAFS internals. By completing this project the developer will become an 
expert in the Microsoft Windows Explorer Shell interfaces and the Microsoft 
Component Object Model (COM).&nbsp; This experience can be reapplied to numerous 
other applications and will prove to be an excellent item on a resume. </p>
<p>The programming language for this project is C/C++.&nbsp; The operating 
system is Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; The project will aim to support Microsoft 
Windows versions from XP SP2 to Vista/Server 2008.</p>
<p>Estimated difficulty: <i>moderate</i></p>

<h2>Project Idea 2: Microsoft Management Console for OpenAFS Cache Manager 
Configuration</h2>
<p>OpenAFS on Windows has a very out of date Control Panel application that is 
used to configure the AFS Cache Manager service.&nbsp; In addition to being out 
of date, the Control Panel is not the appropriate user interface model for 
configuring a system service.&nbsp; On Microsoft Windows, system wide services 
should be configured using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).&nbsp; This 
project is to implement a MMC Add-on for the OpenAFS Cache Manager. </p>
<p>Mockups of a proposed MMC user interface can be found at
<a href="http://www.secure-endpoints.com/openafs-windows-roadmap.html#client service mmc">
http://www.secure-endpoints.com/openafs-windows-roadmap.html#client service mmc</a>.&nbsp; 
This project consists of multiple components that can be successfully 
implemented one at a time.&nbsp; The successful completion of this project does 
not require that all of the proposed MMC pages be implemented.</p>
<p>This project does not require any prior knowlege of AFS nor any knowledge of 
OpenAFS internals.&nbsp; By completing this project the developer will become an 
expert in the Microsoft Management Console interfaces and the Microsoft 
Component Object Model (COM).&nbsp; This experience can be reapplied to numerous 
other applications and will prove to be an excellent item on a resume.</p>
<p>The programming language for this project is C/C++.&nbsp; The operating 
system is Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; The project will aim to support Microsoft 
Windows versions from XP SP2 to Vista/Server 2008.</p>
<p>Estimated difficulty: <i>moderate</i></p>

<h2>Project Idea 3: OpenAFS ptserver extensions for additional authentication types</h2>
<p>In order that authentication systems other than Kerberos 4 be able to be first class authentication systems in the OpenAFS space, extensions to the OpenAFS protections service need to be added. 
</p><p>
More detail on this project can be found <A HREF="gsoc/pts.txt">here</A>.
</p><p>
For successful completion of this project, both the RPC additions and database
extensions will need to be completed. 
<p>This project does not require any prior knowledge of AFS nor any knowledge of OpenAFS internals.&nbsp; By completing this project the developer will become an expert in the OpenAFS ubik database structure as well as in the OpenAFS Rx RPC system.&nbsp; This experience would prove valuable in dealing with other flat database formats, as well as other RPC systems used in distributed applications.</p>
<p>The programming language for this project is C.&nbsp; This is in portable code which can be run on any POSIX-compliant OS; While MacOS, Linux or Solaris are suggested as development platforms due to availability of debugging tools, any supported OpenAFS platform could be used to do this work.</p>
<p>Estimated difficulty: <i>moderate</i></p>

<h1>OpenAFS and Google Summer of Code</h1>
<p>OpenAFS is a 100% open source globally distributed file system derived from 
IBM AFS commercial offering as of 1 November 2000.&nbsp; Since IBM released the 
source code OpenAFS has thrived adding support for new platforms while enhancing 
its overall performance, scalability and usability.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
<h2>GSoC 2009</h2>
For 2009, OpenAFS has been granted 4 slots. The projects which we accepted for 2009 are:
<ol><li>
Project #1: Microsoft Management Console: The project is to build a Microsoft Management Console to manage OpenAFS settings. This is already part of the OpenAFS roadmap on Windows and something I am interested in regardless of Summer of Code. Right now, settings for OpenAFS can be controlled through the OpenAFS control panel or through direct registry modification for some settings. Using the control panel does not work well for managed environments, and direct registry modification is prone to user errors.
<p>
The solution is to leverage the MMC API to build a console for configuring OpenAFS. Issues to be address are whether to use the MMC 2.0 API or the MMC 3.0 API. The difference is that MMC 3.0 is managed and provides better error handling. The management console is essentially a user interface for the appropriate settings, so it is not tightly coupled to the existing OpenAFS source code.
<p>
From there, the user interface needs to be constructed. There are already sample screenshots in the OpenAFS for Windows roadmap as a starting point. Once there is a user interface, actually reading and writing the settings while leveraging elevation in Windows Vista as necessary is the next step.
</li>
<li>Project #2: OpenAFS as a data-driven filesystem. The goal of this project is to enable tagging and searching metadata of items in the AFS filesystem.
<p>Assumptions: single filesystem (server) support, assume interfacing with existing search tools. An indexer, a search service, and documentation and testing with by byproducts of this service. Index data should be mobile with the volume data and stored in a manner which allows ready access from new services. Lucene is being investigated for use in this project.
</li><li>
Project #3: OpenAFS server preference based on network conditions: The OpenAFS cache manager keeps two lists of which servers, the list of VLDB servers and the list of file servers. The VLDB server prioritization list is derived from the CellServDB or AFSDB DNS. The list of file servers is provided by the VLDB, and contains the list of servers hosting a requested volume. The order of these lists is currently decided based on the outdated assumption that the networks will be classful in nature. Unfortunately this type of prioritization is no longer useful with current networks, as the Internet is no longer classful. This leads to an all but random prioritization list.
<p>
This project seeks to change the way the servers in the list are ordered based on network conditions between the client and the possible servers. Rx peer statistics can help provide information about these network conditions. Parts of these statistics can be used to indicate which servers are closest, proximity-wise, to the client as well as create an estimated throughput capacity for the server. These factors can be analyzed to represent performance between the cache manager client and the servers. This will allow for server prioritization based on the best performance of the server and the server's network connection, which subsequently can increase access times. This project will implement this prioritization on both Windows and Unix platforms, taking into account the statistics mechanisms. The Unix implementation will port relatively simply to other Unix implementations (AIX, HP-UX, etc.). 
</li><li>
Project #4: Implementing OpenAFS features into the Linux kafs kernel module: kafs is a Linux implementation of the AFS protocols. While kafs has been maturing, many features contained in OpenAFS are still missing from kafs. This project aims to add some of those features.
<p>
<ul><li>
DNS AFSDB support. Sharing the mechanism used by CIFS will be investigated.
</li><li>
A common pioctl interface. Sharing a pioctl interface between kafs and OpenAFS to allow sharing of userspace binaries such as fs.
</li><li>Implement OpenAFS file system commands. Add support for some OpenAFS commands that have not yet been integrated into kafs.
</li>
<li>Keyring compatibility. Making a standard keyring implementation that would allow the client to obtain authentication tokens that would work for both kafs and OpenAFS.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<h3>GSoC 2009 recruiting</h3>
<p>
It is now 2009, the world economy is collapsing, the U.S. dollar has regained 
much of its value against other currencies and we suspect that many of you are 
thinking about how nice it would be to have US$4500.00 in your bank account (or 
perhaps under your mattress) at the end of the Summer.&nbsp; If you are 
considering applying to OpenAFS for a Summer of Code project and have not 
already read the <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2009/faqs.html">
GSoC 2009 FAQ</a> we suggest that you do so.<p>
As we indicated last year &quot;OpenAFS is a very large and highly complex software 
project consisting of close to one million lines of source code that is severely 
under-documented.&nbsp; As a result it takes a long time for any developers to become 
proficient contributors to the core systems.&quot;&nbsp; We 
discovered during 2008 GSoC that the time it takes for new developers to come 
up to speed is even longer than we expected, especially when the developers have 
little real world experience working on large system projects.&nbsp; Here are some of 
the things that make OpenAFS development particularly challenging:<ol>
	<li>multi-operating system support.&nbsp; Many operating system APIs are not 
	portable between operating system.&nbsp; OpenAFS includes support for a wide 
	range of platforms.&nbsp; As a result the source code can be quite confusing to 
	read.</li>
	<li>multi-threaded programming.&nbsp; OpenAFS makes extensive use of 
	multi-threading.&nbsp; Developing thread-safe code is a challenge for the 
	most experienced developers.&nbsp; It will take a while before you get the 
	hang of it.</li>
	<li>Kernel programming. Portions of OpenAFS are implemented as kernel 
	modules. Developing these can be particularly challenging, as code errors 
	can crash the entire machine. Working effectively on kernel code will 
	require access to a second machine, or to virtualization software.</li>
	<li>Distributed systems.&nbsp; OpenAFS is a highly distributed system with 
	clients and services running on multiple machines communicating over an 
	esoteric remote procedure call system called Rx. This means there's added complexity due to the potential for your work to result in mismatches among disparate pieces.</li>
	<li>Lack of User Experience.&nbsp; Unlike a web browser or a game, you 
	aren't likely to simply download OpenAFS and configure a working OpenAFS cell in under 
	30 minutes so you can experiment with it.&nbsp; Understanding an application 
	and how it works is crucial to being able to develop additional features and 
	functionality that can be added to the system. In order to successfully 
	develop for OpenAFS you will need to be able to get the components you are 
	developing running yourself.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>Infrastructure dependencies.&nbsp; To deploy a working AFS cell you must 
	also have a working DNS and Kerberos deployment.&nbsp; It is very tricky to 
	setup a complete set of OpenAFS client and services on a single laptop for 
	the purpose of development.</li>
	<li>Programming Languages: OpenAFS is written almost entirely in C (and the 
	user interface on Windows is C++) with all of the issues surrounding memory 
	allocation and deallocation, pointer manipulation, stack management, memory 
	leaks, buffer overruns, etc.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>The mix of Version Control Systems, Debuggers, Build Systems, and other development 
	tools will likely be unfamiliar to you.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>Not all of these challenges will apply to all GSoC projects.&nbsp; In fact, 
we have selected project proposals that we believe are manageable by many 
students. If you are unsure about any of the above challenges, OpenAFS has an 
active and friendly community that will be happy to provide you with help and 
guidance. Please join us on #openafs on freenode, or 
openafs@conference.openafs.org on Jabber</p>
<p>Even though OpenAFS is challenging to get familiar with it can be a very rewarding experience; OpenAFS's functionality offers a chance to learn many features, concepts and tools, nearly any of which singly could help you develop 
your career.&nbsp; If you are interested in working on OpenAFS this 
Summer (and perhaps for the rest of your life) here are some things that we 
recommend you do:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you are unfamiliar with programming in C, see if your University has 
	any resources available for assisting their students who want to learn C.&nbsp; If that 
	is not possible, get yourself a good book and try your hand at it. "The "C Programming Language, 2nd edition" by Kernighan and Ritchie is widely considered to be 
	an excellent reference text.</li>
	<li>If you have no idea what multi-threading is or what mutexes, read/write 
	locks, or critical sections are, go to the library and find yourself a 
	book.&nbsp; Preferably one that does not specialize in Java, Win32 or Posix threads, but a good general 
	multi-threading text book.&nbsp; (Search Amazon and read reviews)</li>
	<li>Read the IBM AFS documentation.&nbsp; We are very sorry that it has not 
	been re-written to fully describe OpenAFS.&nbsp; If writing documentation were a 
	permitted GSoC project we would put it high on our list but unfortunately 
	its not.</li>
	<li>Try your hand at building your own DNS, Kerberos and AFS infrastructure.&nbsp;
	<a href="http://tinyurl.com/cexwea">&quot;Distributed Services with OpenAFS&quot;</a> 
	is an excellent cookbook that walks though all of the steps necessary to get 
	all of the pieces up and running.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you apply to OpenAFS please be aware of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>You may not have a second job when working on OpenAFS GSoC.&nbsp; We 
	expect a minimum of 30 hours a week of dedicated work on your project.&nbsp; 
	It is likely that you will need to spend significantly more time than that 
	when you include all of the time spent communicating with your mentor(s) and 
	the community and learning all of the things you do not realize you do not 
	know yet.</li>
	<li>You must have excellent network connectivity on a regular basis.&nbsp; 
	It is going to be extremely hard to develop for a distributed network file 
	system without access to the Internet.&nbsp; In particular, you are going to 
	need to be able to access source code repositories, Kerberos KDCs for 
	authentication, and OpenAFS services.&nbsp; This will require that a broad 
	range of udp ports be open for access to the external world.&nbsp; If you 
	are dependent upon your University's network and they firewall access to the 
	outside world, it may be very difficult or simply not be possible for you to work on OpenAFS.&nbsp; 
	Access to Jabber conference rooms and IRC for communication with your 
	mentors and the community are critical.</li>
	<li>You must know how to compile a C program and use a debugger at a 
	rudimentary level.&nbsp; For Linux, gcc and gdb.&nbsp; For Windows, Visual 
	Studio 2005.</li>
	<li>The time that our mentors spend working with you on a GSoC project is 
	extremely valuable.&nbsp; Mentors have significant work of their own that 
	must be completed.&nbsp; If you are having a 
	problem, communicate it early so that it can be addressed.&nbsp; If you 
	promise to deliver something, do so or warn your mentor as soon as you know 
	that you will miss the promised delivery date.&nbsp; If your mentor is not 
	available, ask on the IRC channel or the Jabber conference room, there are 
	many members of the community that can help.&nbsp; The OpenAFS community will do everything 
	we can to make GSoC a success for you, if you put in the effort at the work and the communication, but we will fail you if you're not putting that effort in.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Communicating with the OpenAFS Community regarding GSoC</h2>
<p>You can speak to members of the OpenAFS Community using two forums:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Jabber Conference Room: openafs@conference.openafs.org</li>
	<li>Internet Relay Chat: freenode.net #openafs channel</li>
</ol>
<p>You may also engage the community via our mailing lists.
<h2>AFS &amp; Kerberos Workshop</h2>
<p>This year's <a href="http://workshop.openafs.org/">AFS &amp; Kerberos Workshop</a> 
is being held at Stanford University the week of June 1 to 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
students working with OpenAFS for Summer of Code are given free admission to the 
tutorials and workshop sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The workshop is an excellent 
opportunity to meet the community and learn more about how OpenAFS works and how 
it is used.</p>
<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
<p>The following are a list of project ideas that members of the OpenAFS 
community believe are not only interesting challenges that can be completed over 
a Summer but that will provide a much needed feature or function for OpenAFS end 
users and administrators.</p>
<h3>1. Prototype a User Interface for Managing Disconnected Operations</h3>
<p>In GSoC 2009, Dragos Tatulea worked with Simon Wilkinson to implement 
<A HREF="http://workshop.openafs.org/afsbpw08/fri_1_3.html">read/write disconnected operations.</A> 
With disconnected operations the contents of the AFS Cache are available for use 
even when it is impossible to communicate with the AFS file servers.&nbsp; The 
challenge for this project is to prototype on Linux or MacOS X a user interface 
that will permit a user to specify which files, directories or volumes are to be 
available for disconnected use at all times and which other objects are 
available for disconnected use as a side effect of the objects being cached due 
to recent use.</p>
<h3>2. Unix or Windows Cache Manager support for Apple Doublefiles (Extended / 
Posix Attributes)</h3>
<p>In order to store arbitrary metadata (aka attributes) with files or 
directories in file systems that do not have the necessary native support Apple 
developed the
<a href="http://users.phg-online.de/tk/netatalk/doc/Apple/v2/AppleSingle_AppleDouble.pdf">
Apple DoubleFile</a> format.&nbsp;&nbsp; AFS does not support arbitrary metadata 
and on Apple MacOS X systems, the operating system will create DoubleFiles 
without additional support from the AFS Cache Manager.&nbsp; This project is to 
implement native support for Apple DoubleFiles in one or more of the AFS Cache 
Managers exporting Posix Attributes on Unix/Linux platforms and Extended 
Attributes on Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; This will permit arbitrary metadata (for 
example, icons, thumbnail images, author, copyright info, gps tags, etc.) to be 
stored in AFS and shared across multiple operating systems without requiring 
changes to the AFS file servers.</p>
<h3>3. AFS as a Data Driven File System</h3>
<p>A challenge of today's data driven computer world is the explosion of digital
data. Somehow this data must be managed and organized. Many digital document
repositories, while good at storing associated metadata about the documents,
do not have an efficient metaphor for working with the data. Most filesystems,
on the other hand, while good at allowing one to work with the files and data
itself, do not have an efficient metaphor for searching and managing the
extended metadata attributes. And while extended attribute conventions do
exist, the extended attributes are usually not applicable to network
filesystems and are usually not easily searchable.</p>

<p>The overall goal of this project is to extend OpenAFS to both store
extended metadata attributes and to allow one to easily work with and
search these attributes. Corollaries include ease of use client side tools.</p>

<p>Phase 1 involves prototyping how to design such a system. A system might be
modeled after existing filesystems like HFS+ and ext 2/3 by using the POSIX
extended attributes API as is. Or, a system might embrace the existing POSIX
api while also offering new functionality. </p>

<p>Phase 2 involves implementing the storing of extended attributes in the
filesystem. One might begin working with apple double files, which do not
require modifying the file server, volume headers, or the afs clients. One
can also use existing commandline tools (or easily write new ones) to work
with the extended attributes themselves.</p>

<p>Phase 3 assumes all volumes on a single file server. The student will work on
a backend to collect the metadata and to make the metadata searchable. This
phase includes thinking about keeping track of changes to file locations,
names, and attributes/metadata.</p>

<p>Additional areas of research would involve expanding to a distributed database
scheme for multiple file servers as well as modifications to afs itself to
more natively store the extended attributes in the filesystem/volumes.</p>
 
<p>The student should have existing skills in relational database design and in
the C programming language. Work will most likely be done on the Linux
platform.</p>
<h3>4. Microsoft Management Console for Windows Client Configuration</h3>
<p>OpenAFS on Windows has a very out of date Control Panel application that is 
used to configure the AFS Cache Manager service.&nbsp; In addition to being out 
of date, the Control Panel is not the appropriate user interface model for 
configuring a system service.&nbsp; On Microsoft Windows, system wide services 
should be configured using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).&nbsp; This 
project is to implement a MMC Add-on for the OpenAFS Cache Manager. </p>
<p>Mockups of a proposed MMC user interface can be found at <a href="http://www.secure-endpoints.com/openafs-windows-roadmap.html#client%20service%20mmc">
http://www.secure-endpoints.com/openafs-windows-roadmap.html#client service mmc</a>.&nbsp; 
This project consists of multiple components that can be successfully 
implemented one at a time.&nbsp; The successful completion of this project does 
not require that all of the proposed MMC pages be implemented.</p>
<p>This project does not require any prior knowledge of AFS nor any knowledge of 
OpenAFS internals.&nbsp; By completing this project the developer will become an 
expert in the Microsoft Management Console interfaces and the Microsoft 
Component Object Model (COM).&nbsp; This experience can be reapplied to numerous 
other applications and will prove to be an excellent item on a resume.</p>
<p>The programming language for this project is C/C++.&nbsp; The operating 
system is Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; The project will aim to support Microsoft 
Windows versions from XP SP2 to Vista/Server 2008.</p>
<h3>5. Read/write volume replication</h3>
<p>OpenAFS currently provides readonly replication of data. Many sites would 
like to use replication on all their data. A proposal exists to address this, 
however, no work has yet been done on implementation. </p>
<p>The goal of this project is create readwrite replication for OpenAFS. The 
proposal can be read
<a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~noora/exjobb/filer.html">here</a> and 
we are available to answer questions about anything further. Experience with systems 
and network programming is highly desirable, however, experience with OpenAFS is 
not necessary. </p>
<p>A student choosing this project will be able to list on a resume and apply 
the skills necessary for developing network-distributed systems, especially with 
regard to file systems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Last year's GSoC project offers code and information which should help you understand what's already done and what pieces remain for you to implement to complete this functionality.</p>
<h3>6. <a name="ptsext">OpenAFS ptserver extensions for additional 
authentication types</a></h3>
<p>In order that authentication systems other than Kerberos 4 be able to be 
first class authentication systems in the OpenAFS space, extensions to the 
OpenAFS protections service need to be added. </p>
<p>More detail on this project can be found
<a href="http://www.openafs.org/pages/gsoc/pts.txt">here</a>. </p>
<p>For successful completion of this project, both the RPC additions and 
database extensions will need to be completed. </p>
<p>This project does not require any prior knowledge of AFS nor any knowledge of 
OpenAFS internals.&nbsp; By completing this project the developer will become an 
expert in the OpenAFS ubik database structure as well as in the OpenAFS Rx RPC 
system.&nbsp; This experience would prove valuable in dealing with other flat 
database formats, as well as other RPC systems used in distributed applications.</p>
<p>The programming language for this project is C.&nbsp; This is in portable 
code which can be run on any POSIX-compliant OS; While MacOS, Linux or Solaris 
are suggested as development platforms due to availability of debugging tools, 
any supported OpenAFS platform could be used to do this work.</p>
<h3>7. Per-file Access Control Lists</h3>
Code implementing per-file ACL permission checks on RPCs received at the server 
was substantially completed.
<p>AFS supports advanced file permissions, using Access Control Lists (ACLs) on 
directories. The traditional AFS permission model is, however, showing signs of 
age. The AFS model is inflexible for administrators, who must store objects with 
disjoint permissions in separate directories. The AFS model is also inconsistent 
with POSIX ACLs (POSIX 1003.1e/1003.2c), DCE DFS, CIFS, and NFSv4 
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3530.txt), all of which allow ACLs (of varying 
types) on a per-file basis. Implementation of this feature will improve the 
usability of OpenAFS for administrators, and improve its interface with modern 
platforms. </p>
<p>The objective of this SOC project is to more fully specify and then implement 
a per-file ACL mechanism for OpenAFS. Engaging with the mentor and the 
community, the student will work out details of per-file ACEs, relationship of 
per-file and existing per-directory ACLs, select an on-disk representation for 
this design in the OpenAFS namei file server, and, minimally, expose the new 
representation to clients via the AFS file server protocol (its FetchACL RPC and 
supporting code, eg, RXFetch_AccessList). The project will close with a 
validation testing phase. </p>
<p>This project will provide an interested student with an opportunity to engage 
with the OpenAFS codebase and development community in a significant way, in 
both design and detailed implementation. The student will gain exposure to the 
complete operation (and end-to-end enhancement) of a major file-system 
features--from on-disk representation to remote procedure invocation, to 
manifestation on the client. </p>
<p>The student should have existing skills in C program implementation in a Unix 
environment, and have minimally completed University courses in data structures 
and algorithms, preferably in C. </p>
<p>More detail on this project can be found
<a href="http://www.openafs.org/pages/gsoc/acls.txt">here</a>.</p>
<h3>8. <a name="kafs">Implementing OpenAFS features into RedHat's kafs kernel 
module</h3>
</a>
<p>The goal of this project would be to bring the Linux kernel kAFS client as 
close to feature-parity with the existing OpenAFS port as possible. Examples 
include: </p>
<ul>
	<li>DNS AFSDB being able to obtain cell server location without using 
	configuration files.</li>
	<li>A common pioctl implementation between kafs and OpenAFS to allow sharing 
	of userspace binaries.</li>
	<li>Making a standard keyring implementation that would allow the client to 
	obtain authentication tokens that would work for both kafs and OpenAFS.</li>
	<li>Implement some of the OpenAFS file system commands that have not yet 
	been integrated into kafs.</li>
	<li>A way for OpenAFS and kafs to be running on the same machine using 
	different port numbers.</li>
	<li>Complete the kafs callback interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last year's GSoC project produced partial documentation of the pioctl 
functions available through AFS, a pioctl syscall and VFS entry point for the 
Linux kernel and implemented some pioctls for the kAFS call.. </p>
<h3>9. Simple Volume and Namespace Management System</h3>
<p>Develop a simple Volume and Namespace management system on
top of OpenAFS.  OpenAFS can be leveraged to create complex namespaces, and
it is an effective wide-area file system.  However, determining exactly how
to configure OpenAFS to scale well across a wide area can be complex.  This
project will take a few specific scenarios and develop parameterized
configurations for them that can then be used by OpenAFS users as
blueprints.  Specific example: create a single namespace split across two
locations, with tools to manage synchronization and replication according to
some basic policies on who can invoke replication and how to control the
bandwidth utilization.</p>
<h3>10. Path MTU discovery</h3>
<p>OpenAFS uses a UDP based RPC transport called Rx. uses the endpoint maximum transfer units (MTUs) to determine how large of a packet may be transmitted without requiring the packet to be broken into fragments on its journey. The prevalence of IP tunnelling, typically with reduced MTUs, on modern internet tpographies, means this is often not an accurate way to determine true maximum packet size. This project would develop and integrate into Rx a mechanism to discover the MTU of the path rather than merely the endpoints, resultingly tuning packet sizes accordingly.</p>
<h3>11. UPnP support</h3>
<p>Network Address Translation, or NAT, is now very common on IPv4 networks due to inavailability of IP space. Port mappings to edge clients, especially for UDP, often do not persist, and there are no well-known mappings to clients behind the NAT device. This sometimes causes problems with the AFS protocol's use of reverse RPCs to communicate conherency information. One technology for registering edge usage of ports is Universal Plug and Play, or UPnP. While not all appliances support it, integrating use of it into OpenAFS clients would offer great potential to improve the client experience for users. A project in this space would develop a new UPnP implementation or utilize a license-compatible implement along with additional work to integrate its use into the existing OpenAFS client codebase.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;12. Surprise Us</h3>
<p>Anything else that you want to submit.&nbsp; Speak with members of the 
OpenAFS Community and brainstorm.&nbsp; Several students from GSoC 2008 
	or current Capstone projects have discussed their own idea and we are 
	looking forward to their submissions.</p>

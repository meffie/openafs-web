<h1>OpenAFS, Network Identity Manager and Google Summer of Code</h1>
<p>The OpenAFS community participates in Google Summer of Code by sponsoring 
students working on OpenAFS and related open source projects such as kAFS and 
Network Identity Manager</p>
<h2>What is OpenAFS?</h2>
<p>OpenAFS is a 100% open source globally distributed file system derived from 
IBM AFS commercial offering as of 1 November 2000.&nbsp; Since IBM released the 
source code OpenAFS has thrived adding support for new platforms while enhancing 
its overall performance, scalability and usability.&nbsp; </p>
<p>OpenAFS has a large, mature codebase of over 800,000 lines of code. It is
used by large enterprises, universities, and research establishments
worldwide, and plays a part in fields from finance through space exploration
to quantum physics. Developing code for OpenAFS gives you the opportunity to
make a significant difference to a product that is in real-world large scale
production use, and to learn key development skills. We have a large,
supportive, community of developers who are keen to see new developers 
enter our project, and happy to help out as you get up to speed.</p>
<h2>What is Network Identity Manager?</h2>
<p>
Network Identity Manager is a client-side
tool designed to simplify the acquisition and management of network 
identities and the credentials used to provide
secure identification to network services on Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; In 2010, 
students, faculty, and 
researchers among others must be able to access services distributed around the world, 
managed by different organizations, and deploying different network 
authentication technologies.</p>
<p>As an example, a scientist at the U.S. Department of 
Energy’s Fermi National Labs must be able to access systems that require three 
different forms of network credentials:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Kerberos v5 ticket granting and service tickets</li>
	<li>Andrew File System (AFS)
tokens</li>
	<li>Short Lived Credential Services X.509 Public Key Certificates</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditionally, the acquisition and renewal of each 
credential type would be performed using distinct tools.  The Kerberos v5 ticket granting ticket would be obtained and managed by a 
Kerberos v5 Ticket Manager (MIT’s Leash on Windows or Kerberos.app on MacOS X).
The AFS Tokens would be obtained by a tool provided by OpenAFS (aklog or 
afscreds).  The short lived X.509 
certificate would be obtained by a tool designed to work with either a 
Kerberized Certificate Authority (KCA) or the Globus MyProxy Credential 
Management Service.  With each new 
credential source, the complexity for the end user is increased.</p>

<p>Network Identity Manager reduces this complexity by 
implementing a Single Sign-On (SSO) framework that permits an initial 
authentication to retrieve not just a single credential but all of the 
derivative credentials necessary for the user to perform their task.
There have been many organization specific tools that have been developed 
over the years to obtain mixed credentials
Unlike previous tools what makes NetIdMgr special is its modularity.
Its pluggable framework model does not require all of the technologies to 
be integrated by the same organization.  
Nor do all users have to be given access to the same combination of 
identity and credential provider modules.</p>
<h2>GSoC 2010</h2>

<p>If you are considering applying to OpenAFS for a Summer of Code project and 
have not already read the 
<a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/faqs">
GSoC 2010 FAQ</a> we suggest that you do so.</p>

<p>OpenAFS is a challenging project to develop for. It is a large and complex
project that has developed over nearly 3 decades. The code must work across a
wide variety of different operating systems, and is heavily multi-threaded in
places. On Unix, the OpenAFS client runs within the machine's kernel, which
can significantly complicate the development process. As an enterprise
product, OpenAFS relies upon significant underlying infrastructure, which a
developer needs to get running before they can test any OpenAFS code. In
addition, OpenAFS is primarily written in C, with all of the attendant issues
of memory management and pointer manipulation.</p>

<p>These challenges mean that students who successfully complete a Summer of
Code are likely to leave with significant new skills. Real world experience of
developing for distributed systems, kernel programming, building test
infrastructures and developing thread safe code are key skills to develop, and
we're happy to help you to learn them. Please join us on #openafs on freenode,
in the Jabber conference openafs@conference.openafs.org, or on the
openafs-devel@openafs.org mailing list.
<p>

<h3>Background reading</h3>
If you are interested in working on OpenAFS this 
Summer (and perhaps for the rest of your life) here are some things that we 
recommend you do:<ol>
	<li>If you are unfamiliar with programming in C, see if your
	University has any resources available for assisting their students
	who want to learn C.&nbsp; If that is not possible, get yourself a
	good book and try your hand at it. "The "C Programming Language, 
	2nd edition" by Kernighan and Ritchie is widely considered to be 
	an excellent reference text.</li>
	<li>If you have no idea what multi-threading is or what mutexes,
	read/write locks, or critical sections are, go to the library and
	find yourself a  book.&nbsp; Preferably one that does not specialize 
	in Java, Win32 or Posix threads, but a good general multi-threading
	text book.</li>
	<li>Read the
	<a href="http://docs.openafs.org">IBM AFS documentation/</a>. We are in
	the process of rewriting this documentation to reflect the
	functionality that is now available in OpenAFS - we 
	apologise that some of it is still out of date.
	
	<li>Try your hand at building your own DNS, Kerberos and AFS
	    infrastructure.&nbsp;
	<a href="http://tinyurl.com/cexwea">&quot;Distributed Services with OpenAFS&quot;</a> 
	is an excellent cookbook that walks though all of the steps necessary
	to get all of the pieces up and running.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>If you apply to OpenAFS please be aware of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>You may not have a second job when working on OpenAFS GSoC.&nbsp; We 
	expect a minimum of 30 hours a week of dedicated work on your project.&nbsp; 
	It is likely that you will need to spend more time than that 
	when you include the time spent communicating with your
	mentor(s), and on developing new skills necessary to complete your
	project.</li>
	<li>You must have excellent network connectivity on a regular basis.&nbsp; 
	It is extremely hard to develop for a distributed network file 
	system without access to the Internet.&nbsp; In particular, you need
	to be able to access source code repositories, Kerberos KDCs for 
	authentication, and OpenAFS services.&nbsp; This will require that a
	broad range of both tcp and udp ports be open for access to the
	external world.&nbsp; If you are dependent upon your University's
	network and they firewall access to the outside world, it may be very
	difficult for you to work on OpenAFS.&nbsp; 
	Access to Jabber conference rooms and IRC for communication with your 
	mentors and the community are critical.</li>
	<li>You must know how to compile a C program and use a debugger at a 
	rudimentary level.&nbsp; For Linux, gcc and gdb.&nbsp; For Windows, Visual 
	Studio 2005.</li>
	<li>The time that our mentors spend working with you on a GSoC project
	is extremely valuable. The majority of our mentors are undertaking
	that role in addition to full time employment. Please make the most
	of their time. If you are having a problem, tell us about it as soon
	as possible so that it can be addressed.&nbsp; If you 
	promise to deliver something, do so or warn your mentor as soon as
	you know that you will miss the promised delivery date.&nbsp; If your
	mentor is not available, ask on the IRC channel or the Jabber
	conference room, and other members of the community will be happy to
	help.&nbsp; We will do all we can to make GSoC a success for you, if
	you put in the effort at the work and the communication, but we will
	fail you if you're not putting that effort in.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Communicating with the OpenAFS Community regarding GSoC</h2>
<p>You can speak to members of the OpenAFS Community using three forums:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Jabber Conference Room: openafs@conference.openafs.org</li>
	<li>Internet Relay Chat: freenode.net #openafs channel</li>
	<li>Mailing list: openafs-devel@openafs.org</li>
</ol>

<h2>AFS &amp; Kerberos Workshop</h2>
<p>This year's <a href="http://workshop.openafs.org/">AFS &amp; Kerberos Workshop</a> 
is being held at Stanford University the week of June 1 to 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
students working with OpenAFS for Summer of Code are given free admission to the 
tutorials and workshop sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The workshop is an excellent 
opportunity to meet the community and learn more about how OpenAFS works and how 
it is used.</p>
-->
<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
<h3>OpenAFS</h3>
<p>The following are a list of project ideas that members of the OpenAFS 
community believe are not only interesting challenges that can be completed
over a Summer but that will provide much needed features or functions for
OpenAFS.</p>

<h4><a name="Userspace_NFS_AFS_translator"></a> Userspace NFS-&gt;AFS translator 
</h4>
<p />
AFS has, for years, had an NFS to AFS translator which loads into the Solaris
kernel. This project would build a new translator for all Unix operating
systems, building on top of the existing userspace AFS cache manager. It offers
the prospective student the opportunity to learn about the internals of both
the AFS and NFS distributed filesystem protocols. An existing knowledge of the
C programming language is required.
<h4><a name="Encrypted_storage"></a> Encrypted storage </h4>
<p />
The AFS protocol offers encryption for data transport from client to server.
However, that data is stored on the server in cleartext, where it can
potentially be read by the administrators of that server. This poses a real
world problem for organisations who wish to outsource the provision of their
file storage, whilst keeping their data confidential. This project would
augment the existing AFS client to support encrypting data blocks before
sending them to the file server. Additional enhancements would manage user and
data keys in such a way that a user can share encrypted files with other AFS
users of their choosing, and protect the names of files, in addition to their
contents. This is a challenging project, during which the student will gain
an in depth knowledge of kernel programming, distributed systems, and
cryptography.
<h4><a name="An_AFS_search_service"></a> An AFS search service </h4>
<p />
Desktop search clients such as Beagle are now widely available. However, they
do not work well with network filesystems and the vast amount of data that may
be remotely stored upon them. This project would develop an AFS search service
which indexes all of the data available on an AFS fileserver, and permit
clients to query that data. Files may be indexed using existing metadata, or
through agents which index objects of particular types. Students will learn
how to specify and extend an existing distributed system, and gain exprience
with information search, indexing and retrieval toolss
<h4><a name="Internationalization_infrastruct"></a> Internationalization infrastructure 
</h4>
<p />
OpenAFS, as a globally-distributed filesystem, has users worldwide, some
of whom no doubt do not speak English even as a second language. This project
would build infrastructure to collect text strings to be internationalized at
build time, and install any provided translations into the finished builds.
Tools and libraries which might be used include xgettext (to collect strings)
and the libintl internationalization suite ("dgettext"), or native platform
methods such as MacOS CoreFoundation ("CFBundleCopyLocalizedString"). Students
will learn how to interface with C libraries, command line tools and build
systems. If you're interested in OpenAFS but find the idea of threaded and
kernel programming to be overwhelming, this may be the project for you.
<h4><a name="Persistent_storage_for_disconnec"></a> Persistent storage for disconnected mode 
</h4>
<p />
Since GSoC 2008, and based on a concept pioneered in the 1990s by UMich CITI 
OpenAFS has supported disconnected operations, meaning cached files can remain
available and editable in the presense of no network. In order to be truly
useful, components are needed to allow selections of files to be stored for
offline use while still online, to cause those files to remain up-to-date
while the client is connected, and to keep in-memory state of the files across
a client shutdown, so reboots can be done while disconnected from the network.
An especially ambitious student might also provide a graphical selection
mechanism for retaining files. Skills learned will include kernel and
threaded programming skills.
<h4><a name="Cooperative_caching"></a> Cooperative caching </h4>
<p />
Clients now have large local disks available to them, and fast local
bandwidth. The remaining issue, in particular in scientific applications
with large datasets, is in the speed of the transport mechanism between the
client and the server hosting the data. In a cluster environment, where a
large number of clients are collaborating on processing the same read-only
data, it shouldn't be necessary for each client to individually fetch the
data from the server - instead a single client should be able to perform the
data fetch, and share the results with all of the other clients in the cluster.
This is a challenging project, developing a design and proof of concept for
entirely new functionality. Skills learned will include the principals of
peer-to-peer filesystems, developing cluster filesystems and kernel programming

<h4>Unix or Windows Cache Manager support for Apple Doublefiles (Extended / 
Posix Attributes)</h4>
<p>In order to store arbitrary metadata (aka attributes) with files or 
directories in file systems that do not have the necessary native support Apple 
developed the
<a href="http://users.phg-online.de/tk/netatalk/doc/Apple/v2/AppleSingle_AppleDouble.pdf">
Apple DoubleFile</a> format.&nbsp;&nbsp; AFS does not support arbitrary metadata 
and on Apple MacOS X systems, the operating system will create DoubleFiles 
without additional support from the AFS Cache Manager.&nbsp; This project is to 
implement native support for Apple DoubleFiles in one or more of the AFS Cache 
Managers exporting Posix Attributes on Unix/Linux platforms and Extended 
Attributes on Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; This will permit arbitrary metadata (for 
example, icons, thumbnail images, author, copyright info, gps tags, etc.) to be 
stored in AFS and shared across multiple operating systems without requiring 
changes to the AFS file servers.</p>
<h4>Read/write volume replication</h4>
<p>OpenAFS currently provides readonly replication of data, but many sites
would like to be able to replicate all of the data, both read only and 
read/write. A proposal of how to implement this within the AFS protocol can
be read
<a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~noora/exjobb/filer.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>This project would be continuing from the work done in this area during the
2008 Summer of Code.<p>A student choosing this project will gain exerience in the skills necessary
for developing network-distributed systems, especially with regard to file systems. </p>
<h4>Implementing Microsoft's Safe String (StrSafe.h) Library for UNIX/Linux</h4>
<p>Microsoft has developed a safe C String manipulation library (StrSafe.h).&nbsp; 
The advantages of the <font color="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #3399ff">
Strsafe</font> functions include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The size of the destination buffer is always provided to the function to 
	ensure that the function does not write past the end of the buffer. </li>
	<li>Buffers are guaranteed to be null-terminated, even if the operation 
	truncates the intended result. </li>
	<li>All functions return an HRESULT, with only one possible success code 
	(S_OK). </li>
	<li>Each function is available in a corresponding character count (cch) or 
	byte count (cb) version. </li>
	<li>Most functions have an extended (&quot;Ex&quot;) version available for advanced 
	functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the opinion of the OpenAFS Gatekeepers that the StrSafe.h functions are 
superior to anything currently available in all of the UNIX/Linux and Windows 
environments supported by OpenAFS.&nbsp; OpenAFS would like to be able to make 
use of the StrSafe.h functions on UNIX/Linux to improve the code quality of 
OpenAFS and further enhance the code sharing across Windows and UNIX/Linux.</p>
<p>This project is to implement from scratch a new implementation of the 
StrSafe.h functionality for use on non-Windows platforms based entirely upon the 
documentation provided by Microsoft: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms647466(VS.85).aspx</p>
<h4>Surprise Us</h4>
<p>Anything else that you want to submit.&nbsp; Speak with members of the 
OpenAFS Community and brainstorm.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Network Identity Manager Project Ideas</h3>
<h4 wrap="">X.509 identity provider / PKINIT integration</h4>
<p>Network Identity 
Manager includes a sample X.509 plug-in that does basic certificate 
management tasks.&nbsp; However it has a long way to go before it can be 
integrated with other plug-ins.&nbsp; This project would involve the design 
and implementation of the user interface extensions needed for supporting 
PKINIT and certificate acquistion workflows.&nbsp; The work will span requirements 
gathering, mock-ups, prototyping, user testing, and final implementation.&nbsp; 
Students wil acquire a working understanding of public key cryptography, 
Kerberos, user interface design, and Windows GUI development.</p><h4>Per process default identities</h4>
<p>The default Kerberos v5 identity for a 
process can be controlled via its environment by specifying the default 
Kerberos v5 credentials cache for the process.&nbsp; However, Network 
Identity Manager currently<br>does not support managing default identities at 
the process level.&nbsp; This project will add that functionality by implementing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A method for selecting the default identity for a running GUI 
process.</li>
	<li>A possible approach would be to implement a hook DLL that 
presents an extra user-interface element for a top level window.</li>
	<li>An option to create a new process with a specific default identity.<br>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a simple per-identity context menu extension.</p>
<h4>Password quality meter and password generation</h4>
<p>The change password dialog 
in Network Identity Manager can be extended to provide feedback on password 
quality, and optionally generate random passwords on behalf of the user.&nbsp; 
Password assessment and generation should be extensible so that dictionary 
checks or other constraints can be added without changing the application 
code.&nbsp; The student will be expected to consult existing literature on 
password quality assessment, design the user interface for exposing this functionality, design the API, and complete the initial implementation.<br>
</p>
<h4>Keytab for initial authentication / Obtain keytab tool</h4>
<p>This enhancement 
is to extend the new credentials dialog to support the use of keytabs, and to 
provide a user interface for creating and managing keytabs.&nbsp; Similar to 
the other enhancements here, the student will be responsible for the design 
of the user interface and the implementation.<br></p>

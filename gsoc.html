<h1>Google Summer of Code</h1>

<p>The OpenAFS project is looking forward to participating as a mentoring
organization in the Google Summer of Code 2022.</p>

<h2>About Google Summer of Code</h2>

<p>Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new
contributors into open source software development.  Contributors work with an
open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance
of mentors.</p>

<p>As of 2022, Google has <a
href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/11/expanding-google-summer-of-code-in-2022.html">opened
up the program</a> to newcomers to Open Source who are 18 years or older.
Projects can be medium size (~175 hours) or large size (~350 hours).  Finish
times are flexible, 12 to 22 weeks, with mentor agreement.</p>

<h2>About AFS and OpenAFS</h2>

<p>AFS is the original cloud file system. AFS is in use at large enterprises,
universities, and research institutions. The OpenAFS code base is 100% open
source.  Since IBM released the source code in 2000, support for new platforms
have been added, performance has been improved, and maintenance and security
updates are delivered by the OpenAFS project.</p>

<p>OpenAFS has a large, mature code base of over 800,000 lines of mostly C
language code. The project includes servers, kernel modules, and command line
tools.  Developing code for OpenAFS gives you the opportunity to make a
significant difference to a product that is in large scale production use, and
to learn key development skills. We have a supportive community of developers
who are keen to see new developers enter our project, and happy to help out as
you get up to speed.</p>

<p>New developers are encouraged to join the
<a href="https://lists.openafs.org/mailman/listinfo/openafs-devel">OpenAFS developers mailing list</a>,
the <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat/openafs">#openafs IRC channel</a>, and the
<a href="https://gerrit.openafs.org/">Gerrit code review system</a>.</p>

<h2>Project Proposal Guidelines</h2>

<p>Students are responsible for writing a proposal and submitting it to Google
before the application deadline.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/gsoc/project-ideas.html">Project Ideas</a> page for
project ideas.  Additionally, we welcome proposals unrelated to the ideas
listed here.</p>

<p>A strong proposal will include, at least:</p>

<h3>General Information</h3>

<dd>Tell us about yourself. What skills do you bring to this
project?  What do you think you will need to learn to complete this
project?</dd>
<dt>Availability</dt>
<dd>How many hours per week will you spend working on this? How many on other
things? What other obligations do you have this summer? Be as specific as
possible.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Project Information</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Project Title</dt>
<dd>In forty characters or less, what you propose to do.</dd>
<dt>Project Description</dt>

<h1>OpenAFS and Google Summer of Code</h1>
<p>OpenAFS is a 100% open source globally distributed file system derived from 
IBM AFS commercial offering as of 1 November 2000.&nbsp; Since IBM released the 
source code OpenAFS has thrived adding support for new platforms while enhancing 
its overall performance, scalability and usability.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
In 2008 OpenAFS participated in Google's Summer of Code.&nbsp;

<h2>
GSoC 2009</h2>
<p>
It is now 2009, the world economy is collapsing, the U.S. dollar has regained 
much of its value against other currencies and we suspect that many of you are 
thinking about how nice it would be to have US$4500.00 in your bank account (or 
perhaps under your mattress) at the end of the Summer.&nbsp; If you are 
considering applying to OpenAFS for a Summer of Code project and have not 
already read the <a href="http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2009/faqs.html">
GSoC 2009 FAQ</a> we suggest that you do so.<p>
As we indicated last year &quot;OpenAFS is a very large and highly complex software 
project consisting of close to one million lines of source code that is severely 
under-documented.&nbsp; As a result it takes a long time for any developers to become 
proficient contributors to the core systems.&quot;&nbsp; One of the things that we 
discovered during 2008 GSoC is that the time it takes for new developers to come 
up to speed is even longer than we expected, especially when the 
developers have little real world experience working on large system projects.&nbsp; 
We are not trying to scare you off, but OpenAFS is possibly among the worst of all possible 
development environments for inexperienced developers.&nbsp; Here are some of 
the things that make OpenAFS development particularly challenging:<ol>
	<li>multi-operating system support.&nbsp; Many operating system APIs are not 
	portable between operating system.&nbsp; OpenAFS includes support for a wide 
	range of platforms.&nbsp; As a result the source code can be quite 
	confusing.</li>
	<li>multi-threaded programming.&nbsp; OpenAFS makes extensive use of 
	multi-threading.&nbsp; Developing thread-safe code is a challenge for the 
	most experienced developers.&nbsp; It will take a while before you get the 
	hang of it.</li>
	<li>Kernel programming. Developing complex applications that sit on top of 
	an operating system is hard enough.&nbsp; When developing a kernel 
	module (or device driver) it gets even worse.&nbsp; One false move and you 
	will crash your machine.&nbsp; Virtual machines are your friend (but not all operating systems OpenAFS supports can be virtualized).</li>
	<li>Distributed systems.&nbsp; OpenAFS is a highly distributed system with 
	clients and services running on multiple machines communicating over an 
	esoteric remote procedure call system called Rx. This means there's added complexity due to the potential for your work to result in mismatches among disparate pieces.</li>
	<li>Lack of User Experience.&nbsp; Unlike a web browser or a game, you 
	aren't likely to simply download OpenAFS and configure a working OpenAFS cell in under 
	30 minutes so you can experiment with it.&nbsp; Understanding an application 
	and how it works is crucial to being able to develop additional features and 
	functionality that can be added to the system.&nbsp; For a highly managed 
	system such as an AFS cell it is necessary to not only understand something 
	about being a user but you must also have some familiarity with being a 
	system administrator.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>Infrastructure dependencies.&nbsp; To deploy a working AFS cell you must 
	also have a working DNS and Kerberos deployment.&nbsp; It is very tricky to 
	setup a complete set of OpenAFS client and services on a single laptop for 
	the purpose of development.</li>
	<li>Programming Languages: OpenAFS is written almost entirely in C (and the 
	user interface on Windows is C++) with all of the issues surrounding memory 
	allocation and deallocation, pointer manipulation, stack management, memory 
	leaks, buffer overruns, etc.&nbsp; Most student developers these days are 
	only used to programming in managed languages such as Java.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>The mix of Version Control Systems, Debuggers, Build Systems, and other development 
	tools will likely be unfamiliar to you.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>Since you are still reading you must either really like challenges or are 
simply insane.&nbsp; Either way, it can be a very rewarding experience; OpenAFS' functionality offers a chance to learn many features, concepts and tools, nearly any of which singly could help you develop a career later, let alone all of them together, if you so chose. If you are seriously interested in working on OpenAFS this 
Summer (and perhaps for the rest of your life) here are some things that we 
recommend you do:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you are unfamiliar with programming in C, see if your University has 
	any resources available for assisting their students who want to learn C.&nbsp; If that 
	is not possible, get yourself a good book and try your hand at it. "The "C Programming Language, 2nd edition" by Kernighan and Ritchie is widely considered to be the best C programming text available.</li>
	<li>If you have no idea what multi-threading is or what mutexes, read/write 
	locks, or critical sections are, go to the library and find yourself a book.&nbsp; 
	Not one specializing in Java, Win32 or Posix threads, but a good general 
	multi-threading text book.&nbsp; (Search Amazon and read reviews)</li>
	<li>Read the IBM AFS documentation.&nbsp; We are very sorry that it has not 
	been re-written to fully describe OpenAFS.&nbsp; If writing documentation were a 
	permitted GSoC project we would put it on the list but unfortunately its 
	not.</li>
	<li>Try your hand at building your own DNS, Kerberos and AFS infrastructure.&nbsp;
	<a href="http://tinyurl.com/cexwea">&quot;Distributed Services with OpenAFS&quot;</a> 
	is an excellent cookbook that walks though all of the steps necessary to get 
	all of the pieces up and running.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are considering applying to OpenAFS please be aware of the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>You may not have a second job when working on OpenAFS GSoC.&nbsp; We 
	expect a minimum of 30 hours a week of dedicated work on your project.&nbsp; 
	It is likely that you will need to spend significantly more time than that 
	when you include all of the time spent communicating with your mentor(s) and 
	the community and learning all of the things you do not realize you do not 
	know yet.</li>
	<li>You must have excellent network connectivity on a regular basis.&nbsp; 
	It is going to be extremely hard to develop for a distributed network file 
	system without access to the Internet.&nbsp; In particular, you are going to 
	need to be able to access source code repositories, Kerberos KDCs for 
	authentication, and OpenAFS services.&nbsp; This will require that a broad 
	range of udp ports be open for access to the external world.&nbsp; If you 
	are dependent upon your University's network and they firewall access to the 
	outside world, it may be very difficult or simply not be possible for you to work on OpenAFS.&nbsp; 
	Access to Jabber conference rooms and IRC for communication with your 
	mentor(s) and the community are critical.</li>
	<li>You must know how to compile a C program and use a debugger at a 
	rudimentary level.&nbsp; For Linux, gcc and gdb.&nbsp; For Windows, Visual 
	Studio 2005.</li>
	<li>The time that our mentors spend working with you on a GSoC project is 
	extremely valuable.&nbsp; Mentors have significant work of their own that 
	must be completed.&nbsp; As such, you should attempt to avoid wasting their time.&nbsp; If you are having a 
	problem, communicate it early so that it can be addressed.&nbsp; If you 
	promise to deliver something, do so or warn your mentor as soon as you know 
	that you will miss the promised delivery date.&nbsp; We will do everything 
	we can to make GSoC a success for you, if you put in the effort at the work and the communication, but we will fail you if you're not putting that effort in.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Communicating with the OpenAFS Community regarding GSoC</h2>
<p>You can speak to members of the OpenAFS Community using two forums:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Jabber Conference Room: openafs@conference.openafs.org</li>
	<li>Internet Relay Chat: freenode.net #openafs channel</li>
</ol>
<p>You may also engage the community via our mailing lists.
<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Prototype a user interface for managing disconnected operations. Read more <A HREF="http://workshop.openafs.org/afsbpw08/fri_1_3.html">here</A> about disconnected AFS.</li>
	<li>Implement support for storing Microsoft Windows Extended Attributes or 
	Posix Attributes in Apple Doublefiles from within either the Windows AFS 
	Cache Manager or the Unix AFS Cache Manager</li>
	<li>
	AFS as a Data Driven Filesystem.&nbsp; Prototype a database driven 
	metadata search engine for use with AFS.
	</li>
	<li>
	Microsoft Management Console for Windows Client Configuration</li>
	<li>
	Read/write volume replication. Last year's project offers code and information which should help you understand what's already done and what pieces remain for you to implement to complete this functionality.</li>
	<li>
	Protection Service Aliasing. OpenAFS provides a service to map human-readable names to internal identifiers, but the names have semantics based on Kerberos version 4. Human readable names for any authentication system should also be able to be used.</li>
	<li>
	anything else that you want to submit.&nbsp; several students from GSoC 2008 
	or current Capstone projects have discussed their own idea and we are 
	looking forward to their submissions.</li>
